<title>Gold Rush</title>
<sub-title>The Beets Dynasty</sub-title>
<desc>The boys are back in Alaska (although Discovery dropped the states mention in the title after the first season) hoping to strike it rich mining for gold. Their first effort was anything but rich and glorious, however, as the crew led by Todd Hoffman and his father, Jack, sunk $250,000 into their dream and came away with just $20,000 worth of gold. The dismal summer was filled with injuries, malfunctioning equipment and constant fighting among the greenhorn miners, yet their serious case of gold fever trumps any talk of giving up and leads to a new operating plan in order to salvage their dream. The series also keeps tabs on the efforts of teenager Parker Schnabel and old-timer Dakota Fred to hit the mother lode at separate sites.</desc>

Using re-creations and firsthand accounts, each episode digs into a case, telling the story of the couples romance, how the relationship evolved from love to manipulation, and what ultimately led the couple to commit the crime. The stories range from teenage lovers who go on a multistate crime spree to lesbian lovers who want to eliminate one of their husbands.</desc>

Using re-creations and firsthand accounts, each episode digs into a case, telling the story of the couples romance, how the relationship evolved from love to manipulation, and what ultimately led the couple to commit the crime. The stories range from teenage lovers who go on a multistate crime spree to lesbian lovers who want to eliminate one of their husbands.</desc>

Using re-creations and firsthand accounts, each episode digs into a case, telling the story of the couples romance, how the relationship evolved from love to manipulation, and what ultimately led the couple to commit the crime. The stories range from teenage lovers who go on a multistate crime spree to lesbian lovers who want to eliminate one of their husbands.</desc>
