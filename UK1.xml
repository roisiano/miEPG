<desc>In 1952, British scientists moored a floating laboratory off Tolsta on the Isle of Lewis to animal test the efficiency of viruses, including bubonic plague, as biological weapons. Bubonic plague once killed half the population of Europe, so the government was appalled when a fishing boat with a crew of 18 sailed through a cloud of virus. The experiments were hushed up, and the fishermen never told of their exposure to the plague.</desc>

Their first effort was anything but rich and glorious, however, as the crew led by Todd Hoffman and his father, Jack, sunk $250,000 into their dream and came away with just $20,000 worth of gold. The dismal summer was filled with injuries, malfunctioning equipment and constant fighting among the greenhorn miners, yet their serious case of gold fever trumps any talk of giving up and leads to a new operating plan in order to salvage their dream. The series also keeps tabs on the efforts of teenager Parker Schnabel and old-timer Dakota Fred to hit the mother lode at separate sites.</desc>
