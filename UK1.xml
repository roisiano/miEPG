<title>Deilbh Dr Hay: An Island Doctors Legacy</title>
<desc>The late Dr John Hay was a highly respected and long-serving GP in Uig and Bernera on the Isle of Lewis from the 1970s to the 1990s. Despite the demands of serving a large practice, he managed to create a vast film archive of life in the community to which he was devoted. Like many island communities at the time, crofting and fishing were the foundation of daily life and the resulting films and photographs are a priceless record of a changing society.</desc>
