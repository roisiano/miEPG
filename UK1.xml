<title>Gold Rush</title>
<sub-title>The Disappearing Pay Layer</sub-title>
<desc>The boys are back in Alaska (although Discovery dropped the states mention in the title after the first season) hoping to strike it rich mining for gold. Their first effort was anything but rich and glorious, however, as the crew led by Todd Hoffman and his father, Jack, sunk $250,000 into their dream and came away with just $20,000 worth of gold. The dismal summer was filled with injuries, malfunctioning equipment and constant fighting among the greenhorn miners, yet their serious case of gold fever trumps any talk of giving up and leads to a new operating plan in order to salvage their dream. The series also keeps tabs on the efforts of teenager Parker Schnabel and old-timer Dakota Fred to hit the mother lode at separate sites.</desc>

<title>Thats Carry On</title>
<desc>A laugh-provoking compilation that harvests some of the highlights from the farcical films of the innuendo-loving `Carry On team. Their brand of bawdy, music-hall humour supplied a hungry nation with a diet of sauce, sauce and yet more sauce. In a cramped projectionists booth, Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor lace up the laughs and unspool classic clips from 20 years worth of mirth-making mayhem.</desc>
