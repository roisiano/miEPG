<sub-title>Winter</sub-title>
<desc>Winter is the greatest test for life in the polar regions, as temperatures plummet to 70 below and winds reach 200kph. Only a few remarkable survivors gamble on remaining in these extreme conditions. In the Arctic, a female polar bear treks into the mountains to give birth. Out on the frozen ocean, the entire population of the worlds spectacled eider ducks braves the winter in a giant ice hole.</desc>

<sub-title>Challenges of Life</sub-title>
<desc>In nature, living long enough to breed is a monumental struggle, and many animals and plants go to extremes to give themselves a chance. Three brother cheetahs band together to bring down a huge ostrich, bottle-nosed dolphins trap fish in a ring of mud, the strawberry frog carries a tadpole high into a tree and drops it in a water-filled bromeliad, and chinstrap penguins undertake a journey through the broken ice to get out to sea.</desc>
