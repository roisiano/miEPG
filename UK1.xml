Filmed in Venezuelas Gran Sabana mountains, Botswanas Okavango Delta, Romanias Carpathian Mountains, the Western Australia coast, and Borneos Brunei jungles, the five hourlong episodes see Stafford - a former British Army captain - attempt to last ten days in the harsh environments with nothing more than a camera. Viewers are provided a fly-on-the-wall perspective as Ed tries to find food, make fire, process water to drink, and build a shelter - among many other life-saving challenges.</desc>

<desc>Adventurer Ed Stafford has walked the length of the Amazon River - he is the first person to accomplish that - and survived alone for 60 days on a desert island near Fiji (a feat chronicled in `Naked Castaway), so perhaps the challenges presented in `Marooned arent that daunting. Filmed in Venezuelas Gran Sabana mountains, Botswanas Okavango Delta, Romanias Carpathian Mountains, the Western Australia coast, and Borneos Brunei jungles, the five hourlong episodes see Stafford - a former British Army captain - attempt to last ten days in the harsh environments with nothing more than a camera. Viewers are provided a fly-on-the-wall perspective as Ed tries to find food, make fire, process water to drink, and build a shelter - among many other life-saving challenges.</desc>
