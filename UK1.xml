<title>Deilbh Dr Hay: An Island Doctors Legacy</title>
<desc>The late Dr John Hay was a highly respected and long-serving GP in Uig and Bernera on the Isle of Lewis from the 1970s to the 1990s. Despite the demands of serving a large practice, he managed to create a vast film archive of life in the community to which he was devoted. Like many island communities at the time, crofting and fishing were the foundation of daily life and the resulting films and photographs are a priceless record of a changing society.</desc>

<sub-title>The Last Dance</sub-title>
<desc>The boys are back in Alaska (although Discovery dropped the states mention in the title after the first season) hoping to strike it rich mining for gold. Their first effort was anything but rich and glorious, however, as the crew led by Todd Hoffman and his father, Jack, sunk $250,000 into their dream and came away with just $20,000 worth of gold. The dismal summer was filled with injuries, malfunctioning equipment and constant fighting among the greenhorn miners, yet their serious case of gold fever trumps any talk of giving up and leads to a new operating plan in order to salvage their dream. The series also keeps tabs on the efforts of teenager Parker Schnabel and old-timer Dakota Fred to hit the mother lode at separate sites.</desc>
