Jargmine, 8,4-palline maa-alune tõuge laastab kogu Põhja-Kalifornia, poorastes selle maapinna pahupidi. Jareltõuked ahvardavad ahelreaktsioonina uhtuda ookeani kogu Ühendriikide laaneranniku. Kui looklaine jõuab San Francisconi, on selle tugevuseks juba 9,2 palli. Maakoore kahjustuste spetsialisti Samantha Hilli oletused saavad kõige jubedamal moel ka kinnituse: jargmise tõuke tugevus peaks olema vahemalt 10,5 palli. Katastroofi arahoidmiseks on ainult uks võimalus - suunatud tuumaplahvatus, mille korraldamiseks võib loa anda ainult president. Kui teadlaste plaan õnnestub, paastab see 50 miljonit inimelu, kui ei .... siis saabub maailma lõpp.</desc>

<sub-title>Albania: Reclaiming the Past</sub-title>
<desc>Forty years after the death of the dictator Enver Hoxha, whose four decade rule over Albania drove it into isolation and poverty, Qasa Alom explores how the country has changed for travellers coming there and for the local people. In Albanias capital, Tirana, he learns how a monument to the late dictator has been repurposed and redesigned for a new generation, before meeting a chef who once fled the country and has now returned to put a new twist on traditional Albanian cuisine. In the countrys southern region, Qasa visits the little-known archaeological treasure of Butrint, before attempting to take part in a swim to Corfu in memory of those who fled the same route during Hoxha rule.</desc>

<title>Schumann - Marchenbilder for viola and piano, Op 113</title>
<desc>Vilde Frang, Tabea Zimmermann and conductor/pianist András Schiff team up for a concert at the 25th anniversary edition of the Swiss Verbier Festival in 2018. András Schiffs versatile artistry excels both as pianist and conductor, as this program illustrates. He is joined by Vilde Frang, a superlative Mozart interpreter, and master violist Tabea Zimmermann for Mozarts Sinfonia concertante. The work exemplifies the vast range of emotion Mozart is capable of instilling in one single work: from serene and joyful in the outer movements, to thoughtful and sad in the central movement. Schumann and Brahms - Schiff accompanies Tabea Zimmermann in the core 19th century viola repertoire. Unlike Schumann, whose Marchenbilder were written with the viola in mind, Brahms wrote his Op.120 for clarinet and piano. He soon provided a viola transcription, which has become as popular than the original.</desc>

<title>Bach - The Well-Tempered Clavier No. 24</title>
<desc>In 1722, when Johann Sebastian Bach lived in Kothen, Germany, he published a book of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys. This collection became known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book One, BWV 846-869. About two decades later, Bach compiled a second book in Leipzig, which became known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book Two, BWV 870-893. Bach intended these pieces for the clavier, which includes the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ. Despite this unclarity, these pieces are regarded as some of the most important works in the history of Western classical music. In this broadcast, Joanna MacGregor plays Preludes and Fugues Nos. 13 to 24 (BWV 858-869) from Book One of Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier, recorded at the Palau Guell in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010.</desc>

For him, Yehudi Menuhin was the reason he become a violinist. At first, his mother became the secretary of Menuhin when Daniel Hoe and his parents moved to London. Hope grew up in Menuhins house and learned not only to love music, but also to make the violin a part of his life. Playing the violin every day is like walking every day, or drinking and eating. He played with Menuhin some of Bartoks Duos which was, according to Hope, an introduction to Bartoks extraordinary music. A piece of Bartok had to be part of this program as well as Ravels Kaddish, the encore Daniel Hope choose when Menuhin conducted his last concert in Dusseldorf.

<title>Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 5</title>
<sub-title>Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 5: Op. 64</sub-title>
<desc>In May 2019, the new principal conductor of the Gewandhaus, Andris Nelsons, presented Tchaikovskys Symphony No. 5 with his orchestra in combination with Shostakovichs Violin Concerto No. 1 with outstanding violinist Baiba Skride as the soloist. In this composition, the violin does not allow itself a break, continually tells its dark story and gets into a vicious circle of ostinato Passacaglia bass lines again and again falls into beguilingly beautiful singing. Tchaikovsky initially thought his "Symphony of Fate" was a failure and believed himself to be at the end of his creative powers. It was probably the composers nature, plagued by self-doubt, that made it almost impossible for him to develop a self-confident attitude to his own creative power. Between this two works, Skride performs Stravinskys Elegy for Solo Violin.</desc>

As its impressive presence is infused with Brahms and Wagner, there is an air of total commitment, only enhanced further by the unusual surroundings. The collaboration of Lisa Batiashvili and Truls Mørk ensures a moving performance of Brahmss last orchestral work, his Double Concerto. Following this, Rattle and the orchestra continue to demonstrate their outstanding musicianship, delivering Wagners amazingly fresh and dynamic Fourth Symphony.</desc>

<title>A Mozart Concert from Berlin</title>
<desc>The Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Chamber Orchestra delivers a program entirely devoted to Mozart at the Konzerthaus in Berlin under the direction of Hartmut Haenchen. In reduced form, the ensemble manages to bring to life the many characteristics of the music and the unique spirit of the famous composer, be it his gaiety of heart, his lyricism, his dramatic side or his polyphonic writing inspired. Criticism has always praised Carl Philipp Emanuel Bachs stylistic assurance, transparency of textures and technical precision. The extraordinary sensitivity and ease of Stefan Vladar make him an ideal partner for Haenchen and his orchestra. The evenings program includes Divertimento, K. 113; the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 20, K. 466, and Symphony No. 41, K. 551.</desc>

<title>Liszt - Due Poemi Sinfonici</title>
<desc>Franz Liszt (1811 - 1886) composed 13 symphonic poems, largely inspired by literary texts. The composer himself wrote piano duet arrangements for these pieces, showcasing his incredible ability of imitating a full orchestra on the piano. Liszt, one of the 19th centurys most important piano virtuosos, strongly influenced the further development of piano music. The Romantic period was the era of the virtuoso pianists: the piano was the instrument of choice for countless musicians and listeners alike. No house of standing could do without a piano: it was a status symbol. Piano music was played in concert halls, palaces, salons, churches and public houses alike. Liszts symphonic poem no. 4, Orpheus, breathes a meditative atmosphere. No. 3, Les Preludes, is best known in its symphonic version - the piano version presented here is rarely heard. The work dates back to the period 1848 - 1854 and was initially meant to serve as introduction to a choral cycle to be based on the texts of the poet Joseph Autran, Les quatre elements: earth, air, water and fire. In this broadcast, the Italian piano duo of Marco Sollini and Salvatore Barbatano performs these Liszt piano works. These recordings were made at the beautiful 12th century church of San Marco in the small but picturesque village of Ponzano di Fermo, as part of the 2015 edition of the annual, itinerant festival "Armonie della sera" in the Italian province of Le Marche.</desc>

Сейчас же он известен прежде всего как православный олигарх, близкий к влиятельной группировке "охранителей" в окружении президента Владимира Путина. Кто же он такой? На чем заработал свое состояние? И как связан с кровавыми событиями в Украине? В этом видео мы расскажем вам о жизненном пути Малофеева - от "главного рейдера России", специализирующегося на хитроумных схемах финансовых махинаций, до агента кремлевского влияния в Европе, лоббиста цензуры в интернете и разжигателя военного конфликта на Донбассе.</desc>

<title>Живет Беларусь</title>
<sub-title>Один из нас</sub-title>
<desc>29 мая исполнится четыре года с того момента, как за Сергеем Тихановским захлопнулись двери тюремной камеры. Четрые года Сергей находится в заключении. Огромный, "сталинский" срок, к которому его приговорили - 19 с половиной лет - вместе с полной информационной изоляцией выглядит попыткой белорусских властей стереть из общественного сознания сам факт существования Сергея. Даже в тюрьме, даже под сроком, близким к пожизненному, Сергей остается опасен для правящего режима. В этом фильме мы хотим осмыслить то, кем сейчас является Сергей Тихановский для беларусов. Какое место он занимает как в общественном сознании в целом, так и в сознании обычных людей? И почему белорусские власти так опасаются его?</desc>

<desc>Документальный фильм показывает зарубежное наследие Мариуполя, Лисичанска, Дружковки и Нью-Йорка. Съемочная группа обнаружила и оживила уникальные, но малоизвестные архивные материалы Донбасса XIX века. Эксперты, историки и местные жители делятся своими рассказами и свидетельствами об истории региона, которая была тщательно уничтожена и искажена советскими властями.

<sub-title>Неизвестная Россия</sub-title>
<desc>Aвторский проект Вадима Кондакова. Это получасовые документальные истории о местах и людях, о которых мало кто знает. И которые станут для зрителя настоящим открытием. Автор побывал в самой самой западной точке страны, в Калининграде, где люди, без света и воды, живут в казематах заброшенного немецкого форта XIX века. И на далеких Курильских островах, в городе-призраке, про жителей которых почему-то забыли на материке. Кроме того, "Неизвестная Россия" расскажет о том, что за таинственный сигнал из космоса поймали в астрофизической обсерватории Нижнего Архыза. И можно ли стать дорожным полицейским, если ты родился в городе дальнобойщиков. В общем, "Неизвестная Россия" показывает страну такой, какой ее не знают даже сами россияне.</desc>

<title>The 77 Percent</title>
<desc>77 per cent of Africas population are below the age of thirty-five yet their interests are under-represented poltically and economically. This show aims to redress the balance by providing a voice to the largest demographic group on the continent. These dynamic younger people are politically engaged and will determine the future path their countries, and the continent as a whole, will follow in the twenty-first century. Presented by Eddy Micah Jr. from Ghana and Wanjiku Mwaura from Kenya, the show promotes a pan-African agenda by encouraging dialogue between the various interested parties. The show pulls no punches when delivering its compelling reports, personal accounts and provocative discussions. A long overdue look at the big issues that affect the youth of Africa.</desc>

<desc>Eco Africa highlights the innovative and inspiring projects from across Africa and Europe that are being put into practice in a a bid to tackle climate change and support our depleting environments.

But more than her strong, warm voice, Dionnes magic is in the silky elegance and the secure delivery with which she tells a story. Thats how her, along with composer Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David become pioneers of the brand of pop music called "Middle of the Road", meaning pop that is grippingly simple, but never trite. Sixty of her hits made it into the American charts and sold over 100 million albums worldwide.

<sub-title>Jazz Open Stuttgart: West Coast All Stars</sub-title>
<desc>This live recording is celebrating 50 years of West Coast Jazz. The West Coast Jazz movement had its origins about 50 years ago in Los Angeles. It was essentially a "cool" form of jazz played mostly by studio musicians as a break from their studio work. The West Coast All Stars are specially brought together for this West Coast Night. The performance shows some of the most important early pioneers of this style of jazz - including legends such as Conte Candoli, Carl Fontana and Teddy Edwards. Jazz writer and critic Alun Morgan about this concert: "Altogether a very impressive experience. These guys are all real jazz pros who can turn in a masterly performance at the drop of a hat. Who said West Coast Jazz was cold and sterile? These guys can churn up enough excitement to bring any audience to its feet."</desc>

<title>The Brothers Four</title>
<sub-title>The Brothers Four: Live in Comblain-la-Tour</sub-title>
<desc>Pioneering folk/pop quartet The Brothers Four was formed in 1957 by University of Washington fraternity brothers Bob Flick (upright bass, vocals), Mike Kirkland (guitar, banjo, vocals), John Paine (guitar, vocals) and Richard Foley (guitar, vocals). Their consistently smooth, warm, and lush harmonies set The Brothers Four apart from others. They turned professional as a result of a practical joke. A member of a competing fraternity arranged for a woman to telephone the band members, identifying herself as the secretary to the manager of Seattles Colony Club and inviting the quartet down for an audition. As soon as The Brothers Four got there, they found that there was no invitation or any audition scheduled - but since they were there anyway, the club manager asked them to play a few songs and ended up hiring them. A few years later, The Brothers Four appeared at a short-lived Belgian jazz festival in Comblain-la-Tour, where they sang the entire book of American Folk Songs.</desc>

From birth, Beets was surrounded by music: he heard classical music from his mother, who is a music pedagogue, and he heard jazz from his father, who has a great fan of Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey. Although Beets parents originally did not associate the word "musician" with the word "career", music is definitely in the familys blood. At this concert at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, Peter Beets teams up with the world-famous guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. With a career spanning almost twenty-five years and including collaborating with dynamic peers like Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, as well as esteemed jazz legends like Joe Henderson, Paul Motian and Gary Burton, Rosenwinkels indelible mark in music is the consummation of being steeped in the rich and deep traditions of jazz, springing off of the shoulders of such vital underpinnings to elevate his own art to new heights, evolving the language in a way no other guitarist has since his arrival. This collaboration between Beets and Rosenwinkel guarantees brilliant music.</desc>

<sub-title>Chamber Music: Sissoko and Segal</sub-title>
<desc>Hailing from a long tradition of Malian kora players, Ballake Sissoko has worked with renowned musicians such as Toumani Diabate and Taj Mahal. He met the French born Vincent Segal by chance, and the two began jamming together, uncertain of what kind of music might result. As a former member of the French National Orchestra, Segals Western classical training does not prevent him from exploring a wide variety of extended techniques, rendering his cello a flexible partner to Sissokos kora. A childhood spent in the Pigalle district of Paris surrounded by immigrant communities exposed Segal to African music from an early age. As such, he possesses a natural sensitivity to Sissokos West-African style. The concert shows a brilliant interplay between the two musicians and combines the several worlds of jazz, Malian and classical music.</desc>

<title>November Music</title>
<sub-title>R. Frerichs/H. Alizadeh/Cello8ctet</sub-title>
<desc>November Music in s-Hertogenbosch has been the Dutch festival for contemporary new music since 1993. The festival offers a great combination of contemporary compositions and experimental pop, sound art, non-Western music, jazz, and improvised music. The closing concert of the 2016 edition is a good example of this musicals richness, hereby the fantastic young trio of composer and pianist Rembrandt Frerichs play together with Cello8ctet Amsterdam and renowned Iranian tar player Hossein Alizâdeh. Dutch pianist Rembrandt Frerichs studied in New York and lived in Cairo for several years. His music has the drive of American jazz and the lyricism of Eastern music, interspersed with recognizable elements from the chamber music of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. The combination of Frerichs with the Cello8ctet and Alizâdeh is unique, as their music is a miracle of organic creativity, a perfectioned example of fusion between music from the old and the new world.</desc>

<sub-title>Germeringer Jazztage: Paco de Lucía and Group</sub-title>
<desc>This broadcast shows a rare appearance at the 1996 Germeringer Jazztage by the legendary flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía and his sextet. Some may question the inclusion of a flamenco guitarist within a jazz festival. However, the similarities between flamenco and blues have been well documented: both are the outlet for a poor, disenfranchised minority, with a primitive strength, boundless capabilities for improvisation and a requirement for breathtaking virtuosity - all qualities shown by Paco de Lucía in this performance. Moreover, he has long been experimenting with jazz forms (evident even from his inclusion of bass, drums, and saxophone in his sextet), while still retaining the essence of the flamenco tradition. In his own words: "What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco".</desc>

<sub-title>Kulli</sub-title>
<desc>Terve elu on Kullit umbritsenud muusika. Kuigi tal on olnud elus palju erinevaid rolle, on ta tõeliselt õnnelik siis, kui saab seista Põlva E-Stuudio laulutudrukute ees ja sustida neisse muusikaarmastust. Sarasilmsed Põlva tudrukud tõestavad, et tõeliste profikooride taset võib saavutada ka Lõuna-Eesti vaikelinnas, kui ainult leidub tublisid dirigente ja põnevat repertuaari. Lisaks Põlva tudrukutele toob Kulli noori koorimuusika juurde ka Heino Elleri nimelises Tartu muusikakoolis, kus ta juhatab kooristuudiot.

<title>Kolm varvi. Sinine</title>
<desc>Poola filmilavastaja Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) Prantsuse lipu varvidest inspireeritud triloogiasse kuuluvad filmid on moodunud sajandi lõpukumnendi uhed mõjusamad linatood, mis mõtestavad lahti Prantsuse revolutsiooni lipukirjaks olnud sõnad - vabadus, võrdsus ja vendlus. Triloogia esimene film "Sinine" on nukker teos prantslanna Juliest (Binoche), kes autoõnnetuse tagajarjel jaab ilma oma mehest ja tutrest. Julie puuab kustutada oma mineviku, et alustada uut elu vabana moodunud elu koidikust - leinast ja armastusest. Sooritades tasahilju enda vaimset enesetappu avastab aga noor naine, et tema elus on koht ka kaunil muusikal ja inimestel, kes temast hoolivad. Filmi pealkiri "Sinine" peaks sumboliseerima vabaduse mõistet. Linateos võitis 1993. aastal Veneetsia filmifestivalil parima filmi "Kuldlõvi" auhinna, filmi peaosaline Juliette Binoche palvis samas parima naisosataitjana Volpi Karika. Linateose muusika autor on Kieslowski pikaajaline koostoopartner ja kahe Kuldgloobuse nominent Zbigniew Preisner ("Europa, Europa"), kes kirjutas muusika kõigile kolmele triloogia filmile.</desc>

<title>Karl ja Marilyn</title>
<desc>Karl on oma kuulsuse tipul, kuid peab seda vaid koormaks. Vabanenud reetlikust habemest, asub ta inimeste sekka elama. Marilyn pole kaugeltki veel masside iidol, kelleks ta kull saada tahaks. Just Karli sekkumine annab talle kauaoodatud võimaluse. Priit Parna animafilm viib kokku kaks ajaloolist tegelast - Karl Marxi ja Marilyn Monroe. Ent loomulikult pole sundmuste keskmes mitte isikud, kelle kaitumise tingivad niigi vaid ajaloolised tingimused. Surrealistliku sundmusterea jaljed kaovad alateadvuse lavel.</desc>

<desc>1978. aasta 20. oktoobril astub Eesti Kunstiinstituudi metsikul peol esmakordselt lavale band, kes kutsub ennast "rocknrolli austajate sektiks". Rock-Hotel purustab kõik publikurekordid, mitu põlvkonda armub "Aita mooda saata oo" laulu kuulates ja selle jarel tantsupõrandal kõikudes. Bandi esimesest peost viimaseni kulub tapselt 43 aastat ja 5 kuud. Harry Kõrvitsa dokfilm raagib kuidas kõik algas, mis mehi selles hotellis kõnetab ja kas huumor, eneseiroonia ning rocknroll on veel sailinud. Autor Harry Kõrvits, film valmis koostoos Telia Inspira ja ERR-iga, tootja Pumpkin Production.</desc>

<desc>Animafilm "1895" on puhendatud filmikunsti 100. aastapaevale. Film vendade August ja Louis Lumiereide elust, mis kasitleb uldsusele seni tundmatuid fakte ning sundmusi kahe kuulsa venna, kes on lainud ajalukku kui kinematograafia leiutajad, elust. Film on illusioon. Kas illusioon on tõde? See vaide ja kusimus olid aluseks autoritele, kui nad võtsid endale õiguse kinnitada, et just nende versioon vendade Lumiereide elust ning filmikunsti sunnist on seni teadaolevatest kõige originaalsem ja ainulaadsem.

<desc>Valentõn Sõlvestrov on Ukraina kuulsaim helilooja, keda saab võrrelda Eestis Arvo Pardiga ja kellega nad igapaevaelus on head sõbrad. Sõja alguses oli ta sunnitud koos tutre ja tutretutrega põgenema Berliini ning teise lapselapse rindele maha jatma. Kuidas see vaevaline teekond autoga õnnestus, kui katki on hing kodust kaugel ja mida tunneb vanaharra Laulasmaal taas oma sõpra kohates, kirjeldab ta intervjuus Juri Muttikale.

Keskajal põimus Kristuse lugu Iiri legendidega ja karikas sai nimeks Puha Graal, mille otsimisest raagivad paljud kirjandusteosed, naiteks „Da Vinci kood“, ja filmid, naiteks „Indiana Jones ja viimane ristiretk“.</desc>

<title>Kolm varvi. Sinine</title>
<desc>Poola filmilavastaja Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) Prantsuse lipu varvidest inspireeritud triloogiasse kuuluvad filmid on moodunud sajandi lõpukumnendi uhed mõjusamad linatood, mis mõtestavad lahti Prantsuse revolutsiooni lipukirjaks olnud sõnad - vabadus, võrdsus ja vendlus. Triloogia esimene film "Sinine" on nukker teos prantslanna Juliest (Binoche), kes autoõnnetuse tagajarjel jaab ilma oma mehest ja tutrest. Julie puuab kustutada oma mineviku, et alustada uut elu vabana moodunud elu koidikust - leinast ja armastusest. Sooritades tasahilju enda vaimset enesetappu avastab aga noor naine, et tema elus on koht ka kaunil muusikal ja inimestel, kes temast hoolivad. Filmi pealkiri "Sinine" peaks sumboliseerima vabaduse mõistet. Linateos võitis 1993. aastal Veneetsia filmifestivalil parima filmi "Kuldlõvi" auhinna, filmi peaosaline Juliette Binoche palvis samas parima naisosataitjana Volpi Karika. Linateose muusika autor on Kieslowski pikaajaline koostoopartner ja kahe Kuldgloobuse nominent Zbigniew Preisner ("Europa, Europa"), kes kirjutas muusika kõigile kolmele triloogia filmile.</desc>

<title>Tiivaulatus</title>
<desc>Irkutskist Sverdlovskisse teel olevas lennukis suttib tulekahjusignaal. Põleb uks mootoritest. Lennukikomandor Seleznjov otsib lennujaama, kuhu maanduda, ent aarmiselt halbade ilmaolusse tõttu sulguvad kõik trassil olevad lennujaamad uksteise jarel. Kui aparatuur naitab tulekahju veel uhes mootoris, on lennuk sunnitud kiiresti kõrgust vahendama. Lennukis tekib paanika, lahendust otsitakse lennujuhtimiskeskuses ja konsulteeritakse nii konstruktorite kui katselenduritega, ent otsuse peab ikkagi vastu võtma lennukikapten Seleznjov ainuisikuliselt.</desc>

<desc>Tõestisundinud lool põhinev film jutustab noorest pereemast nimega Sam Bloom (Naomi Watts), kelle maailm pooratakse pea peale paeval, kui naine õnnetu kukkumise jarel halvatuks jaab. Sami armastav abikaasa Cameron (Andrew Lincoln), tema kolm poega ning ema (Jackie Weaver) naevad tublisti vaeva, et kohaneda uue olukorraga. Pinged koduseinte vahel kasvavad, kuni pere saab ootamatu abilise: vigastatud harakapoja, kellele pannakse nimeks... Pingviin. Linnu saabumine pakub teretulnud vaheldust ning toob kõige suurema muutuse just paljukannatanud Sami jaoks, õpetades teda tasapisi uuesti elama.</desc>

<title>Cyrano</title>
<desc>Ajatu, sudantlõhestav armastuskolmnurk jõuab ekraanile uues kuues. Mitmekulgselt andekas Cyrano de Bergerac (Peter Dinklage) on võidukas, kui on vaja mõni tulinorija verbaalselt paika panna, aga ka vehklemisoskuselt, kui sõnadelt tegudele minnes asi duellini viib. Cyrano suurimaks puuduseks on aga võimetus tunnistada kaunile Roxanneile (Haley Bennett), kuivaga ta teda armastab. Alates hetkest, mil teda esmakordselt nagi. Arvates, et tema valimus valistab igasugused tunded, on ta Roxannei sõbraks, aga ei millekski enamaks. Siis aga armub tudruk Christiani (Kelvin Harrison, Jr.). Noorde sõdurisse, kes on liitunud Cyrano vaeosaga. Peatselt leiab nukker sulesepp end olukorrast, kus elab oma armastust Roxannei vastu valja labi kirjade, mida Christiani nimel talle saadab. "Ma teen sinust sõnaosava, sina minust nagusa," on vahetuskaup, mida Cyrano tahumatule noorsõdurile valja pakub.</desc>

<desc>Nicky kulastas 1938. aasta detsembris Prahat ja leidis perekondi, kes põgenesid ajal, kui natsid hakkasid Saksamaal ja Austrias pead tõstma. Nad elasid halbades tingimustes ilma peavarju ja toiduta, sest neid ahvardas natside invasioon. Ta mõistis kohe, et see on võidujooks ajaga. Mitu last tema ja ta meeskond suudaksid paasta enne piiride sulgemist? 50 aastat hiljem on 1988. aasta ja Nickyt piinab mõte laste saatusest, keda ta ei suutnud turvaliselt Inglismaale viia. Ta suudistab ennast, et ta ei suutnud rohkemat. Alles siis, kui teda ullatab BBC telesari "Thats Life", tutvustades talle ellujaanud lapsi, kes on nuud taiskasvanud, lepib ta lõpuks suutunde ja leinaga, mida ta on viis aastakummet endaga kaasas kandnud.</desc>

<title>Robbie Williams - Live at the Apple Music Festival</title>
<desc>A brand new show that brings a veteran artist at his best! The talented artist, who became famous in the group ""Take That"", lacks presentations, but he himself begins his show by saying: ""Let me resubmit ..."". Robbie Williams has the ability to reinvent himself, exhibiting so much energy that he seems to be a rookie artist. Already in the 40s band of pop music, Robbie is more than an artist consecrated worldwide, is a reference with hits present in the best lists of consecrated DJs. This show at the Roundhouse coincided with the announcement of their 11th solo album, Heavy Entertainment Show, just released. The new albums title reflects Williams performance as energy-dense as his 11-member big band, including his hits partner Guy Chambers on the piano. A formidable 90 minute pop odyssey. Mixing tracks from his Take That era, old or new, his songs allow him to reclaim his throne from an artist who dominates the stage - in fact, there is no one in pop music who combines his monumental energy with music Touching. A magical moment can be perceived in ""A Better Man"", only with the guitar on stage; Proof that he is an artist that goes beyond the scenery. This Blu-Ray shows the trajectory of an artist who knows how to renew himself every lap; An example for the new generations of music that are lost in appearance, forgetting the essential aspect that Robbie Williams is revealing more and more.</desc>

<sub-title>The Who: Live At the Isle Of Wight Festival</sub-title>
<desc>In 2004 The Who returned to the Isle Of Wight Festival for the first time since their legendary performance in 1970. After a long absence, the festival had been reborn in 2002 and continues to this day. Their UK concerts in 2004 were the first in their home country since the death of founder member John Entwistle. As the evening shadows lengthened across the festival site, The Who took to the stage and delivered an incendiary performance packed with hit singles and classic album tracks and the concert more than lived up to the fans expectations and memories of 1970.</desc>

<desc>Евгению Волкову обвиняют в смерти Александра Рабаева - человека, который сел в тюрьму за убийство пятнадцать лет назад, благодаря ее профессионализму и наблюдательности. Перфильева отстраняют от ведения этого дела, и они с Карским начинают самостоятельное расследование. Оказывается, что разгадка кроется в прошлом жертвы, который становится другой личностью благодаря непреднамеренной лоботомии. Творческое участие Аси в этом расследовании показывает, что у патологоанатома Волковой растёт достойная смена.</desc>

<title>Monteverdi - Vespro della Beata Vergine</title>
<desc>In 1610, Monteverdi gave his Vespers for the Virgin in Mantova, before conquering Saint-Marks Basilica in Venice. It is the first great religious masterpiece of baroque. It has remained one of the key works in the universal musical heritage. After the genius of Orfeo (1607), the Vespers use its opening fanfare again and confirm Monteverdi as the main composer of his time. Sir John Elliot Gardiner conducted this work for the first time in 1964 and recorded it twice. It is for this work that he founded the Monteverdi Choir, one of the best choirs in the world. For their 50th anniversary in 2014, they perform Monteverdis masterpiece Vespro della Beata Vergine at the Chapelle Royale de Versailles in France. The Monteverdi choir performs this masterpiece with the English Baroque Soloists and Les Pages du Centre de musique baroque de Versailles. The soloists are Silvia Frigato, Emanuela Galli, Raffaele Pè, Krystian Adam, Nicholas Mulroy, Gareth Treseder, Alexander Ashworth, and Robert Davies.</desc>

<title>Monteverdi - Vespro della Beata Vergine</title>
<desc>In 1610, Monteverdi gave his Vespers for the Virgin in Mantova, before conquering Saint-Marks Basilica in Venice. It is the first great religious masterpiece of baroque. It has remained one of the key works in the universal musical heritage. After the genius of Orfeo (1607), the Vespers use its opening fanfare again and confirm Monteverdi as the main composer of his time. Sir John Elliot Gardiner conducted this work for the first time in 1964 and recorded it twice. It is for this work that he founded the Monteverdi Choir, one of the best choirs in the world. For their 50th anniversary in 2014, they perform Monteverdis masterpiece Vespro della Beata Vergine at the Chapelle Royale de Versailles in France. The Monteverdi choir performs this masterpiece with the English Baroque Soloists and Les Pages du Centre de musique baroque de Versailles. The soloists are Silvia Frigato, Emanuela Galli, Raffaele Pè, Krystian Adam, Nicholas Mulroy, Gareth Treseder, Alexander Ashworth, and Robert Davies.</desc>

What makes the form so popular? Is this music skillful or just comforting? Are its composers Mozart 2.0 or rather maestros for the masses? Do they build a bridge to the musical past, allowing our ears to roam comfortably in familiar territory? The documentary traces the journey of some of the protagonists of the genre by telling their stories, and seeking answers from sociologists, neuroscientists, musicologists and even marketing experts. But above all, it allows these creators - these weavers - to have their say. Directed by Anne-Kathrin Peitz 2021</desc>

His phenomenal tenor voice made him famous worldwide and he became the first superstar. The background to a hitherto little-known assassination attempt in Cuba sheds new light on the legendary voice of the century, which is now part of humanitys cultural heritage. Enrico Caruso is a phenomenon, produced by Italian opera at the end of the 19th century. And to this day it remains its greatest mystery. How was a child from a poor background able to celebrate such great successes at the Metropolitan Opera in New York? What is the basis of his myth? Directed by Norbert Buse</desc>

<sub-title>Strauss: An Alpine symphony - DSO Berlin,Robin Ticciati, Reinhold Messner</sub-title>
<desc>Recorded at Berlins Tempodrom, the Deutsche Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and its chief conductor Robin Ticciati present Richard Strausss An Alpine Symphony as a musical and philosophical mountain hike with the legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner. The concert leads us through the Alps, lets the audience pass flowering meadows en route, through thickets and underbrush, over mountain pastures and glaciers to the summit, and finally the descent surrounded by thunderstorms. Messner provides insights into the physical and psychological borderline experiences of his mountain ascents and speaks about extreme situations, the perception of nature, and his mental state on the night before departure, during the conquest of the peak, during the long, onerous descent and the exhausted, contented return home.</desc>

<desc>Raagiti, et nende valduses on Puha Graal, et nad tunnevad Jeesuse jareltulijaid ja avastasid Uue Maailma sajand enne Kolumbust. Neid on kutsutud "maailma kõige salajasemaks uhinguks". Templiruutlid olid keskaja Euroopa kõige võimsam usuuhendus. Oma peakorterites Jeruusalemmas ja Pariisis lõid Templiruutlid midagi, mida peetakse meie aja panganduseks - nad rahastasid paavste, kuningaid ja impeeriumeid, edendades samas religiooni ja heategevust. Kui aga Templiruutlid sattusid konflikti Prantsuse kuningaga, tembeldati nad reeturiteks, saatana kummardajateks ja veelgi hullemaks. Vandenõuteoreetikud usuvad, et nende allasurutus ja põrandaalune tegevus panid aluse vabamuurlusele ja muudele salauhingutele, mis on siiani mõjuvõimsad.

<title>Ameerika I Maailmasõjas</title>
<desc>As much as the American participation in World War II has been clearly noted, the presence of the American soldiers - nicknamed the "Sammies" (sent by Uncle Sam) - on French soil during the Great War is virtually unknown. And yet, 2 million Sammies arrived in France between 1917 and 1918 to fight alongside French and English troops. They have been stuck in the trenches, buried in a rain of shells, exhausted by the noise and tormented by hunger. 53,000 perished, 234,000 were injured and 4,500 went missing. Without the participation of these men, the conflict could have ended entirely differently. Indeed, they proved to be the undisputed artisans of Allied victory and hoisted their country to the rank of worlds leading military and economic power. Through unreleased archives and contemporary footage shot in the archeological digs of World War Is battlefields, this film tells the heroic and tragic tale of the American soldiers in this terrible conflict. Still today, many clues, objects and graves are randomly uncovered during the course of archeological projects carried out around the front lines and in the battlefields. They provide an emotional account of this violent tale and of the emergence of a nation.</desc>

<desc>Nach seiner Wahlniederlage im Jahr 2020 rekrutierte Donald Trump Fanatiker, Fantasten und Profiteure, um das amerikanische Volk davon zu uberzeugen, dass die Wahl manipuliert worden war, und um einen Weg zu finden, die Verfassung zu untergraben. Dieser Verschworung stand eine Handvoll republikanischer Funktionare im Weg, die die Verfassung an erste Stelle setzten und einen hohen Preis dafur zahlten, das Richtige zu tun.</desc>

<title>Donald Trump - Mythos, Macht and Manipulation</title>
<desc>This alarmingly topical documentary reveals how Donald Trumps conspiracy to sub- vert the United States constitution took shape, why it led to the violence of January 6th and how ultimately it was defeated. The story is told from the inside, by former allies and supporters of the President, from the Vice Presidents office down. The "Steal" was defeated, but the lie created a permanent fissure in an already polarised nation. This time Trump is better organised and already he is claiming - again - that if he loses, then the election will have been rigged. As 2024 looms, the world must prepare for a renewed, more potent assault on American democracy from a well-drilled authoritarian network armed with four years preparation.</desc>

In diesem Mikrokosmos der Gefangniswelt gelten eigene Regeln und Gesetze: Haftlinge kampfen ums Überleben, Gangs um die Vorherrschaft und das Wachpersonal darum, die Oberhand zu behalten. In einigen der beruchtigten Gefangnisse gelingt es ihnen, in anderen haben sie beinahe vollstandig die Kontrolle verloren. "Locked Up!" stellt sie vor.</desc>

Stars Hollows Connecticutis on võluv, vaike ja pisut omanaoline linnake, kus elab piisavalt ekstsentrilisi tegelasi. Põikpaine 32-aastase Lorelai Gilmore on loonud mugava, sooja, kofeiinirikka elu endale ja oma sama kangekaelsele tutrele Roryle.

<title>Danny Silk _ Austuse kultuur</title>
<desc>Austuse kultuur tutvustab lootuse, austuse ja eesmargiga taidetud elukeskkonda! Danny Silk esitab kirikule valjakutse katsuda labi oma juhtimisstruktuur, tuues esile avarapilgulise nagemuse koguduse viiest teenimisametist. Jeesus raagib uhest vaga olulisest printsiibist Matteuse 20:25-26: "Te teate, et rahvaste valitsejad peremehetsevad nende ule ja suured meelevallatsevad nende kallal. Nõnda ei tohi olla teie seas, vaid kes iganes teie seas tahab saada suureks, olgu teie teenija." Alles siis, kui hakkame praktiseerima vastastikuses austuses uksteisest ette jõudmist, saame tõesti tuua Jumala riigi maa peale. Võid praktiseerida seda võimsat õpetust igapaevaselt perekonnas, tookohas, kogukonnas, koguduses ja teenistuses ning kõikjal, kus puutud kokku inimestega. Danny Silk teenib koos oma abikaasa Sheriga Betheli koguduses, Reddingis Californias. Danny on Ülemaailmse Muutumise Instituudi direktor ja Betheli meeskonna arengujuht. Danny ja Sheri Silk on asutanud õppeteenistuse nimega Love on Purpose, mis on mõeldud pere- ja kogukondadele ule maailma.</desc>

<title>Порча</title>
<desc>Программа Порча, которую можете смотреть онлайн - это докудрама о реальных жизненных ситуациях. Иногда в окружении появляется тот, кто желает зла настолько, что не остановится ни перед чем. Зависть, ненависть и другие негативные чувства толкают людей к контакту со сверхъестественным. И в нашей жизни наступает черная полоса. Мы задаемся вопросом: почему все валится из рук, преследуют несчастья, болезни и невезение в любви и браке? Ответ на этот вопрос может быть простым, но зловещим: на вас навели порчу. Смотрите онлайн докудраму Порча на телеканале Домашний, в которой герои обращаются к Тамаре - женщине, обладающей сверхъестественными способностями. Она может увидеть, есть ли на человеке отметка тьмы, и помочь отвести беду. В каждом выпуске программы будет воссоздан реальный случай из практики Тамары - когда отчаявшиеся люди обращались к ней за помощью. Тамара расскажет, как узнать, что на вас навели порчу, и что делать, если это действительно произошло. На официальном сайте телеканала Домашний вы можете смотреть онлайн все серии докудрамы Порча в хорошем качестве.</desc>

Вернуться его заставляет известие о скоропостижной смерти деда - старого рыбака и единственного близкого родственника. Здесь его помнят: когда-то он служил в местном УМВД, и у него осталось много знакомых по обе стороны закона. Общаясь с ними, он понимает, что гибель деда не была случайной: в это время в городе идёт активная скупка земли, за которой стоит местный бизнесмен Боровиков. Познакомившись с сотрудницей филиала океанографического института Инной, Андрей встречается с дельфином Анни. К удивлению девушки, Кораблёв уверяет, что понимает язык дельфинов и что её настоящее имя - Василиса! Настоящая дружба, возникшая между человеком и дельфином, оказывается большой подмогой в расследовании гибели деда.</desc>

<title>Дельфин</title>
<desc>В небольшой приморский городок возвращается уроженец этих мест, московский оперативник Андрей Кораблёв. Вернуться его заставляет известие о скоропостижной смерти деда - старого рыбака и единственного близкого родственника. Здесь его помнят: когда-то он служил в местном УМВД, и у него осталось много знакомых по обе стороны закона. Общаясь с ними, он понимает, что гибель деда не была случайной: в это время в городе идёт активная скупка земли, за которой стоит местный бизнесмен Боровиков. Познакомившись с сотрудницей филиала океанографического института Инной, Андрей встречается с дельфином Анни. К удивлению девушки, Кораблёв уверяет, что понимает язык дельфинов и что её настоящее имя - Василиса! Настоящая дружба, возникшая между человеком и дельфином, оказывается большой подмогой в расследовании гибели деда.</desc>

<title>Порча</title>
<desc>Программа Порча, которую можете смотреть онлайн - это докудрама о реальных жизненных ситуациях. Иногда в окружении появляется тот, кто желает зла настолько, что не остановится ни перед чем. Зависть, ненависть и другие негативные чувства толкают людей к контакту со сверхъестественным. И в нашей жизни наступает черная полоса. Мы задаемся вопросом: почему все валится из рук, преследуют несчастья, болезни и невезение в любви и браке? Ответ на этот вопрос может быть простым, но зловещим: на вас навели порчу. Смотрите онлайн докудраму Порча на телеканале Домашний, в которой герои обращаются к Тамаре - женщине, обладающей сверхъестественными способностями. Она может увидеть, есть ли на человеке отметка тьмы, и помочь отвести беду. В каждом выпуске программы будет воссоздан реальный случай из практики Тамары - когда отчаявшиеся люди обращались к ней за помощью. Тамара расскажет, как узнать, что на вас навели порчу, и что делать, если это действительно произошло. На официальном сайте телеканала Домашний вы можете смотреть онлайн все серии докудрамы Порча в хорошем качестве.</desc>

<title>Parasiit</title>
<desc>Üks suvaline kelder uhes Seouli agulis Koreas. Kimide perekonna poeg ja tutar uritavad kemmergus ulemise korruse ari wifit varastada, ema voldib kokku pitsakarpe (mis on ka pere ainus "ametlik" sissetulek), isa aga kamandab tanavalt mooduvat prussakamurki pritsivat autot nahes aknaid avama, et korterile tasuta tõrjet saada. Ühiskonna põhjakihti kuuluva, ent kokkuhoidva perekonna jaoks avaneb aga peagi elu võimalus, sest nende poeg kutsutakse inglise keele eraõpetajaks ulirikkuritest Parkide villasse. Parast rida osavaid (ja ulimalt koomilisi) manipulatsioone on terve Kimide perekond teenindamas miljonaride perekonda, kellel pole pole õrna aimugi, et need inimesed omavahel kuidagi seotud on. Ja see on sisuliselt alles loo sissejuhatus… "Parasiidi" eest esimesena Korea režissoorina autorikino hinnalisima auhinna, Cannesi filmifestivali Kuldse Palmioksa palvinud Bong Joon-ho ("Malestused mõrvast", "Keha", "Snowpiercer", "Okja") varskeim film on võhmale võtva tempo ja hingekriipiva pingega komoodia-põnevik-tragoodia-sotsiaalne melodraama ja veel kõik, mis nende žanrite vahele jaab. Rabava detailitunnetusega jaadvustatud lugu raagib sotsiaalsest olelusvõitlusest ja klassisõjast, mille lahinguvali ulatub materiaalsest sfaarist aistinguliseni. Samaaaegselt umberlukates ja siis jalle provokatiivselt kinnitades erinevaid sotsiaalseid klišeesid ja eelarvamusi, vaatajal uskumatute sužeepooretega vaipa pidevalt alt tõmmates ning kujutades oma karaktereid vaheldumisi nii hoolimatute lurjuste, hoolivate pereliikmete kui oma umbritsevate olude kaitsetute ohvritena, on Bong saanud valmis oma karjaari kõige olulisema teosega ning tõusnud Aasia kino vaieldamatuks suurkujuks.</desc>

<title>Die Wahrheit uber unsere Rente</title>
<desc>Die nachsten zehn Jahre werden Deutschland verandern: 14,5 Millionen Menschen gehen in Rente. Wird es gelingen, die Rente zu sichern? Und wer wird den Preis dafur zahlen?
