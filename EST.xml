<desc>14 Jahre Ermittlungen in der Sarkozy-Gaddafi-Affare Am Montag 6. Januar begann vor dem Pariser Strafgericht der funfte Prozess in funf Jahren gegen Nicolas Sarkozy. Der ehemalige franzosische Staatsprasident wird wegen "passiver Korruption, krimineller Vereinigung, illegaler Wahlkampffinanzierung und Hehlerei in Bezug auf die Veruntreuung libyscher offentlicher Gelder" angeklagt. Ihm drohen bis zu zehn Jahre Haft, eine Geldstrafe in Hohe von 375.000 Euro und eine funfjahrige Nichtwahlbarkeit. Ihm wird vorgeworfen, seine Prasidentschaftskampagne 2007 u. a. mit Mitteln des libyschen Regimes Muammar al-Gaddafis finanziert zu haben. Der damalige Innenminister Nicolas Sarkozy soll Gaddafi im Gegenzug eine wirtschaftliche und diplomatische Rehabilitierung Libyens versprochen haben, das damals auf der internationalen Buhne isoliert war. In dem komplexen Fall stehen elf weitere Angeklagte vor Gericht, darunter die engen Vertrauten und Ex-Minister des ehemaligen Staatschefs, Claude Gueant, Brice Hortefeux und √âric Woerth. Heute empfangen wir den Investigativjournalisten der Zeitung Mediapart, Fabrice Arfi, um uber den Prozess zu sprechen. Er war 2011 fur die ersten Enthullungen in dieser Affare verantwortlich und war am Szenario des Films "Personne ny comprend rien" von Yannick Kergoat beteiligt, der ab dem 8. Januar im Kino zu sehen ist. Kann Frankreich noch lange ohne neuen Haushalt auskommen? Frankreich steht erneut vor einer Haushaltsprufung. Trotz eines im Dezember 2024 verabschiedeten Sondergesetzes, das die reibungslose Arbeit der offentlichen Institutionen sicherstellen und einen Stillstand verhindern soll, muss die Regierung von Fran√ßois Bayrou einen Haushaltsgesetzentwurf verabschieden lassen. Der neue Wirtschaftsminister Eric Lombard scheint diesmal mit der Linken auf der Grundlage der von der vorherigen Regierung durchgefuhrten Arbeiten am Haushalt diskutieren zu wollen, wobei er deutlich gemacht hat, dass er eine Haushaltskurzung um etwa 50 Milliarden Euro anstrebt, d. h. insgesamt weniger als die von seinem Vorganger vorgesehenen 60 Milliarden Euro. Er versicherte, keine neuen SteuermaSSnahmen einzufuhren, die hohere Besteuerung der obersten Einkommen jedoch beibehalten zu wollen, damit "jeder einen gerechten Anteil an der Steuer zahlt". Ebenso soll der von der Regierung Barnier ausgearbeitete und mit den groSSen Unternehmen bereits diskutierte Aufschlag auf die Korperschaftssteuer beibehalten werden. Wird dies ausreichen, um den Entwurf des Haushaltsgesetzes im Parlament verabschieden zu lassen, wahrend das Wirtschaftsministerium fur 2025 ein Haushaltsdefizit von 5 % bis 5,5 % des BIP erwartet? Zum Schluss prasentiert Xavier Mauduit den Schriftsteller des 19. Jahrhunderts Jules Champfleury, der das erste Buch uber die Geschichte der Karikatur veroffentlicht hat und die Arbeit der Karikaturisten verteidigte; und Marie Bonnisseau berichtet uber die umstrittene Veroffentlichung einer Liste von 425.000 Niederlandern, die unter Verdacht stehen, mit den Nazis zusammengearbeitet zu haben.</desc>

<title>Zu Tisch ...</title>
<sub-title>Kalabrien, Italien</sub-title>
<desc>Fur den Bauer Giuseppe Vadal√† und seinen Mitarbeiter Vincenzo ist die Ernte der Bergamotte die schonste Zeit des Jahres: Die Frucht verbreitet namlich schon beim Pflucken ihr intensives Aroma und erfullt die ganze Plantage mit ihrem frischen Duft. Anders als in Norditalien gibt es in Kalabrien keine Fabriken mit 10.000 Arbeitsplatzen. In kleinen, vertrauten Familienbetrieben wird hier die Ernte noch per Hand erledigt. Routinierte Pflucker wie Vincenzo und Giuseppe schaffen zwischen 600 und 800 Kilogramm an einem einzigen Tag. Die Bergamotte stellt zudem ein botanisches Ratsel dar: Sie wird zwar auch in anderen Landern wie der Elfenbeinkuste und Argentinien angebaut, doch nirgendwo sind die Baume so ertragreich und die Fruchte so aromatisch wie in Kalabrien. Denn nur hier gibt es die optimalen Wachstumsbedingungen wie den mineralischen Boden und das gemaSSigt feuchte Mikroklima. Beruhmt fur ihr unverkennbares Aroma, findet die Bergamotte in der Parfumindustrie und zum Beispiel beim Earl-Grey-Tee Verwendung. Giuseppe und seine Mutter Maria aber verfeinern mit der Zitrusfrucht zahlreiche Gerichte: marinierten Schwertfisch, Risotto, Farfalle mit Thunfisch sowie Kuchen. Weitere Spezialitaten sind kalabrische Makkaroni und auf dem offenen Feuer gekochter Lammtopf. Es zeigt sich, dass die Esskultur in Kalabrien einen hohen Stellenwert hat: In Giuseppes Familie bedeutet Kochen nicht bloSS Mahlzeiten zuzubereiten, sondern auch Vertrautheit und Zusammenhalt zu spuren.</desc>

<title>Deadly Predators</title>
<sub-title>Predator Power</sub-title>
<desc>In this episode, Steve goes in search of some of the most powerful predators on the planet. At historic Warwick Castle, we meet the stellar sea eagle, the worlds heaviest eagle. Our eagle Nikita is an expert at lifting fish up to one third of her body weight out of the ocean to eat. To demonstrate this amazing ability up close, Steve has one of the coolest pieces of tech in Deadly history - a time slice rig. Using this, Steve is able to analyse Nikitas predatory power from every angle. Next, Steve goes head-to-head with one of the strongest land predators - the bear. Bears arent just strong, they are incredibly agile too. During the summer they have to catch and eat up to 30 whole salmon before hibernation. Steve puts this to the test by wearing a bear suit and being drenched in water - can he catch as many salmon as a hungry bear? On a mission to find the worlds most powerful punch, Steve tries his hand at boxing with a fairground punching machine. He is no match for our professional boxer Isaac though, who gives Steve a few punching tips. However, when it comes to powerful punches, nothing can beat the peacock mantis shrimp. Despite being only six inches long, it punches with the same power as a bullet. We see in incredible CGI what a human-sized mantis shrimp could do to our boxing machine. Steve then reveals its secret superpower - it doesnt just hit with its punch, it also creates a shockwave of energy in the water. Steve supersizes this and blows up a fish tank full of water with some plastic explosives. Finally, Steve comes face to face with his favourite animal in the world - the wolf. At a special zoo in the UK, Steve meets a real wolf and a hybrid wolf, and puts their pack and jaw power to the test - can he win a tug of war with our wolf using a real deers leg. We then head to the quarry, where Steve shows us how a wolf uses its powerful jaws to hang on to prey by trying his hand at a bucking bronco.</desc>

<title>Life Story</title>
<sub-title>First Steps</sub-title>
<desc>In this series David Attenborough brings us the universal story that unites each of us with every animal on the planet; its the story of the greatest of all adventures - the journey through life. For animals there is just one goal in life - to continue their bloodline in the form of offspring; the next best thing to immortality. This series shows how animals attempt to overcome the challenges that face them at each of the six crucial stages of life as they strive towards ultimate success. In this first episode animals overcome their first great hurdle - surviving infancy. Flightless Barnacle Goose chicks face their greatest challenge at the very start of their lives. In order to find food they must leap 400ft down a cliff, from the ledge where they hatched. Young fur seals in New Zealand have found the perfect place to learn how to avoid predators like Killer Whales. Instead of swimming out to sea they have discovered a stream that leads into the forest, and ends at a magical splash-pool below a waterfall. Here the youngsters learn together in perfect safety. The little known Long-eared jerboa, deep in the Gobi desert, has the largest ears relative to its body of any animal on earth. On its first night alone it learns how to use its astonishing hearing to detect insect prey in the darkness. Albatross chicks make their first flight from the Pacific island where they were born. But huge tiger sharks are waiting for any that misjudge and land on the sea.</desc>

<sub-title>Growing Up</sub-title>
<desc>David Attenborough explores how animals attempt to overcome the challenges that face them at each of the six crucial stages of life as they strive towards ultimate success - passing on their genes. This episode follows animals as they grow up in the adult world, developing new skills and learning how to survive on their own. A tiger cub grows up in a very dangerous society. She needs the support of both parents if she is to become an independent adult, but the appearance of a rival to her father may change everything. The veined octopus spends almost all of its time feeding as it races towards adulthood, but this leaves it exposed to predators. In order to protect itself it searches for bits of discarded coconut shell that will fit neatly together. Then it uses them as protective armor. A pair of young cheetah siblings are in a race against starvation. They can only survive by working together to bring down big prey for the first time - an impala weighing more than both cheetahs put together.</desc>

Many of these destinations are primarily "off the grid" in some of the most remote locations on earth, including Georgia Swamplands USA, Swedish Arctic Circle, Wilderness Island Australia and the Sahara Desert. Men, either alone or with a family, sacrifice the comforts and almost any social life to experience the hardships, challenges and rewards of a life that is constantly challenged by nature and be at one with nature. Being largely dependant on their own abilities, Ben Fogle experiences their way of living for a week to understand the reasons behind why they chose this new way of living. Released on Channel 5 in the UK, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild was produced by Motion Content Group and Renegade Pictures.</desc>

<title>Schumann - Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13</title>
<desc>After recording all 32 Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas to celebrate the composers 250th birth anniversary, celebrated Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz decided to record solo piano works by Robert Schumann. In this performance, Schwartz presents Schumanns Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13. Composed between 1834-37, the work began as a theme and a set of sixteen variations. The theme had been composed by Baron von Fricken, an amateur musician and father of Ernestine von Fricken, to whom Schumann was engaged in 1834. The work was first published in 1837, containing the theme and twelve etudes (only nine of them were indicated variations). Fifteen years later, in 1852, Schumann published a second edition of the work, eliminating two etudes and making some revisions to the piano writing. Acclaimed pianist Riccardo Schwartz (1986) has performed as a soloist with many world-renowned conductors, including Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov. His acclaimed performances include recitals and concertos for piano and orchestra in many prestigious concert halls.</desc>

<title>Heitor Villa-Lobos Music for Cello and Piano - IV</title>
<desc>In this six-part documentary on the life and work of Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, director Liloye Boubli takes viewers on a journey through the life and work of this legend of Brazilian classical music. The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887. Growing up during a time of immense social change in Brazil - with the abolishment of slavery in 1888, this was a time of social revolution and far-reaching modernizations - Villa-Lobos went on to become one of South Americas best-known composers of all time. This fourth episode dives deeper into the composers "Bachianas brasileiras", particularly the "√Åria (Cantilena)" from Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, which is one of Villa-Loboss most renowned pieces.</desc>

<title>De Falla - El sombrero de tres picos</title>
<desc>Spanish conductor Garcia Navarro leads the Radio Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart in a performance of Manuel de Fallas El sombrero de tres picos (The three-cornered hat). Originally a ballet score, De Falla composed the piece in 1916 and 1917. The ballet was commissioned by Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his Ballets Russes, and saw its premiere at the London Alhambra Theatre in 1919. As De Falla was interested in traditional Spanish folk music, he included elements of this music in his score. The mezzo-sopranos parts are examples of cante jondo, a vocal style in flamenco. In this performance, recorded in 1988, mezzo-soprano Paloma Perez I√±igo handles those vocal parts with conviction.</desc>

<title>Verdi - Nabucco</title>
<desc>Israeli-born conductor Daniel Oren leads the Orchestra of the Arena di Verona in a magnificent interpretation of Giuseppe Verdis Nabucco. Verdis third opera - but first great popular success - was created at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan in 1842, in the epicentre of the "Risorgimento" and the capital of Italian nationalism, at a time where the supporters of Italian independence from Austrian occupation were starting to make their voices heard. The "Chorus of the Hebrew slaves", pivotal point in the third act where the Jews, exiled from Babylone by Nabuchodonosor, mourn their country, "So Beautiful and Lost", immediately resonated with the Italian nationalists and has ever since been a symbol of Italian national identity. Daniel Oren, a true connoisseur of Verdis musical language as well as a regular guest at the Arena di Verona, conducts with great panache this "lyrical epic" that holds such a special place in the heart of all Italians. This interpretation was recorded 2017 and stars George Gagnidze, Susanna Branchini, Nino Surguladze, Rubens Pelizzari, Stanislav Trofimov and more.</desc>

<title>Heitor Villa-Lobos Music for Cello and Piano - II</title>
<desc>In this six-part documentary on the life and work of Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, director Liloye Boubli takes viewers on a journey through the life and work of this legend of Brazilian classical music. The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887. Growing up during a time of immense social change in Brazil - with the abolishment of slavery in 1888, this was a time of social revolution and far-reaching modernizations - Villa-Lobos went on to become one of South Americas best-known composers of all time. In this second episode, Liloye Boubli dives deeper into the oeuvre of Villa-Lobos, exploring his musical influences and scrutinizing the anatomy of some of his most famous compositions, particularly his early "Pequena Su√≠te" for cello and piano. This collection of dances and short pieces in six movements is indicative of the composers heartfelt adoration for Johann Sebastian Bach.</desc>

<desc>Renowned French string quartet Quatuor √âb√®ne marked the 250th birth anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) with a remarkable project: recording all of the great composers sixteen string quartets. For five years, violinists Pierre Colombet and Gabriel Le Magadure, violist Marie Chilemme, and cellist Rapha√´l Merlin immersed themselves in Beethovens 650 pages of sheet music. Their efforts culminated in the performance of the composers complete repertoire for string quartet, which covers three decades of Beethovens musical creativity, during six impressive concerts at Philharmonie de Paris in the autumn of 2020. Quatuor √âb√®ne explored every facet of Beethovens string quartet repertoire: from the youthful Opus 18 string quartets to the Razumovsky, Harp, and Serioso quartets (Opus 59, 74, and 95) from his middle period, and finally, the depth of his late quartets (Opus 127 to 135).

An unusual feature of the symphony is that it consists of only three movements, making it the only major symphonic work from the Classical period without a minuet or scherzo movement. The symphony opens with an Adagio introduction followed by a hugely powerful Allegro, with dramatic qualities that foreshadow Mozarts opera Don Giovanni. Directed by J√°nos Darvas.</desc>

<sub-title>North Sea Jazz Club: Marnix Busstra Band</sub-title>
<desc>Guitarist, composer and director Marnix Busstra loves crossing borders. He travels the world with his jazz bands, plays guitar and bouzouki, writes jazz and theatre-songs, and co-creates and directs the exuberant theatre shows of his wife, the Dutch diva Karin Bloemen. Busstra is a constant wheel of invention, with technique expanded by his creative urge to find something new, an evolving state that adds immeasurably to his art. The Marnix Busstra Band was founded in 2011 by its namesake. Joined by piano talent Rembrandt Frerichs, the ever creative double bassist Arnold Dooyeweerd and the inspirational force of drummer Pieter Bast, Busstra introduces a unique band that will definitely help broaden the jazz horizon. Marnix compositions are the starting point of the band. Musically, this band is a continuation of a development started by the quartet that Marnix co-leads with the renowned vibraphonist, Mike Mainieri. The result can best be described as lyrical, multifaceted jazz that centres around the profound interplay of the four musicians.</desc>

<title>Live at Paradiso, Amsterdam - Robert Jay Band</title>
<desc>Does a crisis stimulate creativity? When COVID-19 prevented the Robert Jay Band from performing for live audiences in 2021, the idea for "Paradiso Sessions" sprang forth. Funk, rock, and soul guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Robert J. Reinders mused, "if our audience will not come to see us, then we must go to see them". Hence the Robert Jay Band settled down in an atmospheric Paradiso in Amsterdam to perform for nine cameras. Among the twelve recorded songs is 1994s monster hit Red Bullet. The remote audience gets to enjoy spirited musical contributions from Tollak Ollestad (vocals, keyboards, harmonica), Danjil Tuhumena (guitar, percussion, vocals), Roni Jonker (bass), Sietse Huisman (drums), and visiting band members Jasper Westerhof (keyboards), Dewi Pechler (backing vocals), and Merel van Eldik (backing vocals).</desc>

<sub-title>Brussels Jazz Orchestra: Changing Faces</sub-title>
<desc>This might come unexpected, but the Brussels Jazz Orchestra (BJO) is not the kind of jazz orchestra that sticks to standards. They prefer to achieve the highest level by composing original music, creating unique arrangements, and playing inventively as well as passionately. In fact, it really is jazz with a dynamic orchestral sound, with a classic strength in which each musician is also a brilliant soloist. Call it an "orchestrated passion for jazz" that incites BJO to create world-class music. Founded in 1993 by Frank Vaganee, Serge Plume and Marc Godfroid, the Brussels Jazz Orchestra is recognised and has been subsidised by the Flemish Government since. Brussels Jazz Orchestra is orchestra in residence at Flagey in Brussels. During this project the BJO performs with David Linx. The Belgian jazz singer will resort to any idiom, any language, any time signature. Occasionally he seems to dispense with bar lines altogether, or he will go beyond lyrics, as he abandons his own words for some free-wheeling scat.</desc>

<title>Where Are We Now - Part I</title>
<desc>German jazz and cabaret singer Atrin Madani was born in 1998 as the son of Iranian immigrants. In the face of pandemic uncertainty, geopolitical upheaval, and social unrest in his ancestral home country, Madani asked himself: where are we now? His response to this question is as clear and precise as his singing: what we need most right now is honesty, humility, and quality. All of these are abundantly present on the Berlin-based vocalists debut album. Inspired by the sound aesthetics of Mel Torme, Norah Jones, Diana Krall, and Till Bronner, Madani dedicates himself to a handpicked selection of songs that have so far remained largely unsung in jazz. At this festive album release concert at jazz club A-Trane Berlin in March 2023, Madani was accompanied by pianist Christian von der Goltz, guitarist Alexander RueSS, bassist Olaf Casimir, and drummer Sebastian Merk.

After her debut at an amateur talent show in 1934, Ella joined Chick Webbs Orchestra with which she recorded several hits; after Webb died, she became the leader of the orchestra. In the late 1940s, Ella Fitzgerald became known as the First Lady of Song, with her wide vocal range of three octaves. The American jazz singer was particularly appreciated for her pure tone, intonation and phrasing, and unparalleled improvisational abilities. In a career that spanned close to 60 years, Fitzgerald sold 40 million albums and won 13 Grammy Awards, mainly for her definitive interpretations of the Great American Songbook.</desc>

<desc>Hoogne komoodia 1970ndate algusest, mille peaosades saravad duona legendaarne prantsuse koomik Louis de Fun√®s ning naitleja ja laulja Yves Montand, kelle mitmed laulud on saanud uuemaks klassikaks. 17. sajandi Hispaania. Rahandusminister don Salluste (Louis de Fun√®s) kukub karjaariredelilt ja otsustab Hispaania kuningannat kattemaksuks habistada. Don Salluste kavandatud keerulisse intriigi on haaratud teener Blaze (Yves Montand), too aga on omakorda hadas vastumeelse ja pealetukkiva seltsidaamiga. Ning muidugi kasvab kogu ettev√µtmine peagi pooraseks. R: Gerard Oury.</desc>

<sub-title>Rock-Hotel. Kuidas laks sul see mang</sub-title>
<desc>1978. aasta 20. oktoobril astub Eesti Kunstiinstituudi metsikul peol esmakordselt lavale band, kes kutsub ennast "rocknrolli austajate sektiks". Rock-Hotel purustab k√µik publikurekordid, mitu p√µlvkonda armub "Aita mooda saata oo" laulu kuulates ja selle jarel tantsup√µrandal k√µikudes. Bandi esimesest peost viimaseni kulub tapselt 43 aastat ja 5 kuud. Harry K√µrvitsa dokfilm raagib kuidas k√µik algas, mis mehi selles hotellis k√µnetab ja kas huumor, eneseiroonia ning rocknroll on veel sailinud. Autor Harry K√µrvits, film valmis koostoos Telia Inspira ja ERR-iga, tootja Pumpkin Production.</desc>

<title>Kolm varvi. Sinine</title>
<desc>Poola filmilavastaja Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) Prantsuse lipu varvidest inspireeritud triloogiasse kuuluvad filmid on moodunud sajandi l√µpukumnendi uhed m√µjusamad linatood, mis m√µtestavad lahti Prantsuse revolutsiooni lipukirjaks olnud s√µnad - vabadus, v√µrdsus ja vendlus. Triloogia esimene film "Sinine" on nukker teos prantslanna Juliest (Binoche), kes auto√µnnetuse tagajarjel jaab ilma oma mehest ja tutrest. Julie puuab kustutada oma mineviku, et alustada uut elu vabana moodunud elu koidikust - leinast ja armastusest. Sooritades tasahilju enda vaimset enesetappu avastab aga noor naine, et tema elus on koht ka kaunil muusikal ja inimestel, kes temast hoolivad. Filmi pealkiri "Sinine" peaks sumboliseerima vabaduse m√µistet. Linateos v√µitis 1993. aastal Veneetsia filmifestivalil parima filmi "Kuldl√µvi" auhinna, filmi peaosaline Juliette Binoche palvis samas parima naisosataitjana Volpi Karika. Linateose muusika autor on Kieslowski pikaajaline koostoopartner ja kahe Kuldgloobuse nominent Zbigniew Preisner ("Europa, Europa"), kes kirjutas muusika k√µigile kolmele triloogia filmile.</desc>

<title>Karl ja Marilyn</title>
<desc>Karl on oma kuulsuse tipul, kuid peab seda vaid koormaks. Vabanenud reetlikust habemest, asub ta inimeste sekka elama. Marilyn pole kaugeltki veel masside iidol, kelleks ta kull saada tahaks. Just Karli sekkumine annab talle kauaoodatud v√µimaluse. Priit Parna animafilm viib kokku kaks ajaloolist tegelast - Karl Marxi ja Marilyn Monroe. Ent loomulikult pole sundmuste keskmes mitte isikud, kelle kaitumise tingivad niigi vaid ajaloolised tingimused. Surrealistliku sundmusterea jaljed kaovad alateadvuse lavel.</desc>

<title>Bernadette</title>
<desc>Biograafiline draamakomoodia, mille peaosas sarab prantsuse filmidiiva Catherine Deneuve.

Prantsusmaal vaga tuntud daam polnud esialgu rahva seas eriti armastatud, ajapikku tema populaarsus aga kasvas ja 2002. aasta presidendisvalimiste ajal mangis see juba olulist rolli. Peagi hakkas oma naise poliitilist vaistu uha enam hindama ka Jacques Chirac. R: Lea Domenach. Teistes osades Michel Vuillermoz, Denis Podalyd√®s, Sara Giraudeau.</desc>

Uued lossiomanikud ei karda kummitusjutte, nad peavad neid... natuke vanamoelisteks. √úksk√µik, kui √µudseid lugusid Sir Canterville valja m√µtleb, meeldivad need perekonnale vaga. Vana kummitus tiirutab oma lossis ringi, hoides peast kinni! Kuidas on see v√µimalik?! Otiste vembumeestest poisid, kaksikud Kent ja Louis, hirmutavad hoopis teda ennast! Ja saadiku naine, proua Lucretia, soovitab sooril oma kolisevad ketid √µlitada, sest selle mura sees on v√µimatu uinuda! Sir Canterville on asja parast vaga mures. Kui asjad nii jatkuvad, kaotab ta igaveseks maine k√µige hirmsama kummitusena! Ootamatult aga s√µbruneb Sir Canterville pere noordaami Virginiaga. V√µluv kummitus raagib talle oma uskumatu eluloo ja siis algavad t√µelised seiklused, mis on tais p√µnevaid ullatusi.</desc>

<title>Maksus√µjad</title>
<desc>Viimasel 40 aastal on rahvusvahelised korporatsioonid raputanud maailma majandust. Nad teenivad igal aastal kolm triljonit dollarit kasumit, mis on taganud neile tohutu rikkuse, ja ometi on nende maksukoormus koduriigi ees peaaegu olematu. Valitsused saarase maksudest k√µrvalehiilimise ees taiesti j√µuetud ja riigid jaavad ilma sadadest miljarditest maksutuludest. Samal ajal suurenevadl ebav√µrdsus, vaesus ning populism.

<title>Jake Bugg - Live at Hype Machines Hype Hotel</title>
<desc>Nineteen-year-old British singer-songwriter Jake Bugg is a man of few words, that is until he begins his strumming. His unique voice is one that finds few, yet highly admirable comparisons - perhaps a rockabilly-folk twangy twist of The Mountain Goats John Darnielle and Colin Meloy of the Decemberists. The release of his self-titled, full-length debut last October sent a sonic shockwave through the music world with songs like the feverishly hooking foot-pounder "Lightning Bolt" and the howling 60s rock sing-along "Two Fingers". Jake took the stage late one evening at Hype Machines Hype Hotel, where he roared through his catalog of catchy hits for an rock-hungry crowd. And we were there to catch the solid solo kid in action.</desc>

<title>Jake Bugg - Live at Hype Machines Hype Hotel</title>
<desc>Nineteen-year-old British singer-songwriter Jake Bugg is a man of few words, that is until he begins his strumming. His unique voice is one that finds few, yet highly admirable comparisons - perhaps a rockabilly-folk twangy twist of The Mountain Goats John Darnielle and Colin Meloy of the Decemberists. The release of his self-titled, full-length debut last October sent a sonic shockwave through the music world with songs like the feverishly hooking foot-pounder "Lightning Bolt" and the howling 60s rock sing-along "Two Fingers". Jake took the stage late one evening at Hype Machines Hype Hotel, where he roared through his catalog of catchy hits for an rock-hungry crowd. And we were there to catch the solid solo kid in action.</desc>

<title>Jascha Heifetz - Gods Fiddler</title>
<desc>Jascha Heifetz - Gods Fiddler Not since Paganini had there been such a magician on the violin, a musical "wunderkind" who went on to set the standards for nearly a century. Through home movies and personal family photos taken from 1903-1987, this documentary filmed in Vilna, Lithuania, Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Los Angeles, re-creates a life that spanned the 20th Century. We hear from all the great violinists of his generation, and from many of his former students who are still alive, that Heifetz was a legendary but mysterious figure whose story embodies the dual nature of artistic genius. Is the man and the artist the same person? What is the price each pays? And who was the man behind the music? Directed by Peter Rosen 2011</desc>

<desc>The Sound Weavers: Ludovico Einaudi, Hauschka, Joep Beving, Hania Rani Sold-out concerts, millions of albums sold to make the classical music industry green with envy: neoclassical, as the new musical trend is called, is a mega hit. What makes the form so popular? Is this music skillful or just comforting? Are its composers Mozart 2.0 or rather maestros for the masses? Do they build a bridge to the musical past, allowing our ears to roam comfortably in familiar territory? The documentary traces the journey of some of the protagonists of the genre by telling their stories, and seeking answers from sociologists, neuroscientists, musicologists and even marketing experts. But above all, it allows these creators - these weavers - to have their say. Directed by Anne-Kathrin Peitz 2021</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love - but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time?</desc>

<desc>18. augustil 1985 lendavad neli tsiviilpilooti tagasi lennunaituselt, kui nad markavad lahenemas h√µbedast raketikujulist objekti, mis nende lennuki alt labi s√µidab. Nad pooravad umber ja uritavad objektile jargneda, kuid see on liiga kiire. Nad annavad olukorrast teada, kuid keegi oska seda selgitada. 8. jaanuaril 1981 markab p√µllumees oma p√µllul maandumas kummalist objekti. √ïige pea t√µuseb objekt taas √µhku. Mees markab objekti maandumiskohas jalgi ja otsustab olukorrast teatada. Uurimisest hoolimata ei j√µuta rahuldava seletuseni. 1989. aasta l√µpust kuni 1990. aasta kevadeni nagid tuhanded belglased kolme tulukest, mis lendasid kolmnurgakujuliselt ule taeva. Tulukesi margati nii linnades kui ka maal ning asja saadeti uurima isegi F-16 √µhuj√µudude lennukid.</desc>

Kaks ood hiljem margatakse sarnast valgust metsas, kus parajasti liigub baasiulema abi koos meeskonnaga. Itaalia ufoloogile saadetakse anonuumselt nimetud dokumendid, mis kirjeldavad Veneetsias 1936. aastal nahtud UFOsid. Selgub, et tegemist on valitsuse salajaste dokumentidega UFOde kokkupuudetest, millele jargnes p√µhjalik valitsusepoolne varjamine. Dokumentidest selgub, et UFOsid varjati Itaalia diktaatori Mussolini kasul, kes oli veendunud, et inimesed olid tunnistajaks mingile Euroopas valjatootatud uuele tehnoloogiale. 15. septembril 1952 s√µidab 20-aastane Nils Frost jalgratta seljas kodu poole.

Ettev√µtte peamist uhkuse allikat, nuudseks tuhmunud hiilguse sumbolit, Eesti reisilaeva Estonia, tabas samasugune saatus. Parvlaev uppus tavaparasel reisil Stockholmi ning 800 reisijat hukkus.

<title>Deutschland im Rausch - Drogenkonsum auf dem Vormarsch</title>
<desc>Politik, Polizei und Praventionsstellen schlagen Alarm. Drogen sind in Deutschland seit Jahren auf dem Vormarsch. Knapp 10 Prozent aller Erwachsenen haben in den letzten 12 Monaten mindestens einmal eine illegale Droge konsumiert - das sind rund 4,9 Mio. Menschen. Im vergangenen Jahr sind 2227 Menschen am Konsum illegaler Drogen gestorben. Das ist ein trauriger Rekordwert. Ohne Zweifel besteht Handlungsbedarf. Doch welche Strategie ist die Richtige? Drogenfahnder der Polizei versuchen den Handel vor Ort zu unterbinden. Zollbeamte fuhren rigide Kontrollen an den AuSSengrenzen durch. Andere Ansatze wollen die Konsumenten schutzen: in legalen Druckraumen konnen Suchtige unter medizinischer Aufsicht konsumieren, ohne Polizeikontrollen furchten zu mussen. Beim sogenannten "Drug-Checking" testet geschultes Personal Party-Drogen auf Verunreinigungen, damit die Clubnacht nicht zum Albtraum wird.</desc>

<title>Kiirabi</title>
<desc>Los Angeles. √úhe plahvatusliku paeva jooksul muutub kahe mehe elu poordumatult. Autasustatud s√µjaveteran Will Sharp (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) vajab meeleheitlikult raha, et tasuda oma naise ravikulude eest. Ta laheb abi paluma inimeselt, kelle poole oleks targem mitte poorduda - selleks on tema kasuvend Danny (Jake Gyllenhaal), karismaatiline "vaikeettev√µtja", kelle "projektid" pole kahjuks kunagi seaduslikud. Nii ka nuud. Ta pakub Willile osalust Los Angelese ajaloo suurimas pangaroovis, mille eeldatava saagi suuruseks on 32 miljonit dollarit. Kuna kaalul on tema armastatud abikaasa ellujaamine, ei suuda Will sellest pakkumisest keelduda. Ent kui roovile jargnema pidanud p√µgenemine nurjub, kaaperdavad nurka aetud vennad kiirabiauto, milles on raskelt haavatud politseinik (Jackson White) ja tipp-parameedik Cam Thompson (Eiza Gonz√°lez). Poorase tagaajamise kaigus, mis ei peatu hetkekski, peavad Will ja Danny pusima sammu v√µrra eespool ulekaalukatest politseij√µududest, hoidma elus oma pantvangid ning puudma teineteist mitte maha luua. Seda k√µike keset hullumeelset tagaajamist, mis poorab segi pool Los Angelest.</desc>

Allerdings wird die Zeit langsam knapp: Sarah steht jeden Tag auf der Buhne und die Wohnung muss zum Folgemonat bereits vermietet sein, da die Kosten sonst aus dem Ruder laufen. Der Druck macht der Musicaldarstellerin zu schaffen - und Fehler auf der Baustelle bleiben neben der ganzen Tanzerei nicht aus. Leider schnellen dadurch auch die Kosten des Projekts in die Hohe.

<sub-title>Das Wohnwagen-Battle</sub-title>
<desc>Christina hat sich fur ein ungewohnliches Bauprojekt entschieden. Ein Mobilheim auf dem Campingplatz soll fur immer ihr Zuhause sein. Die 29-Jahrige hat es sich in ihrem ungewohnlichen Schnappchenhaus bereits gemutlich gemacht. Einziges Manko: Das Paradies verursacht viel zu hohe Heizkosten. Die Ursache: Das Dach ist nicht isoliert. Deshalb soll ein Neues her - und zwar schnell. Vor dem ersten Kalteeinbruch soll "die warme Mutze" auf dem Kopf des Hauschens sitzen. Da Christina selber wenig Bauerfahrung hat, ubernimmt ihr groSSer Bruder Andre das Kommando. Er hat sich eine ganz ausgefallende Konstruktion ausgedacht. Denn einfach Dammwolle unter das Dach stopfen - wie bei einem gewohnlichen Haus - das geht im Mobilheim der kleinen Schwester nicht. Hat Andre seinen Masterplan auch wirklich gut durchdacht? Oder wird Christina im Kalten sitzen bleiben? Auch Rhon (38) und Freundin Jana (30) wollen es sich auf Radern gemutlich machen. Das Parchen hat sich ein Grundstuck in Brandenburg gekauft. Anstatt ein Haus darauf zubauen, wollen sie hier einen alten, 7 Quadratmeter groSSen Bauwagen zum Wochenenddomizil umbauen. Dieser befindet sich noch im Urzustand und erinnert sehr an karge Bauarbeiterromantik. Die Dammung fehlt, und einen richtigen Boden und eine Schlafmoglichkeit gibt es auch nicht. In nur drei Wochen soll der Wagen fertig sein, denn dann stehen die ersten Gaste vor der Tur.</desc>

<desc>Punkte, Cashback, Rabatte: welche Kundenkarten lohnen sich wirklich? Die beiden groSSten Supermarktketten Deutschlands haben ihre Bonus-Systeme geandert. Statt Payback gibt es bei Rewe seit Ende Dezember ein eigenes Programm. Edeka hat Payback eingefuhrt. Im Einzelhandel verspricht fast jeder, treue Kunden zu belohnen, wenn sie sich registrieren. Aber welche Kundenkarten lohnen sich wirklich und welche verfuhren uns dazu, mehr auszugeben als wir wollen ? Das zeigt "Life" in einem aufwandigen Experiment. AuSSerdem durfen die Reporter hinter die Kulissen der Rabatt-Macher schauen und klaren, warum die Supermarkte unbedingt wollen, dass wir alle ihre Kundenkarten im Portemonnaie haben. HeiSSes Duell auf eisiger Piste: Skisprunglegende Sven Hannawald und Bob-Olympiasieger Andre Lange beim Hornschlittenrennen in Garmisch Mit bis zu 100 km/h rasen die Teilnehmer bei diesem traditionellen Hornschlittenrennen in Garmisch-Partenkirchen uber einen Kilometer lang ins Tal. Einfache Holzschlitten, die einst Holz oder Heu transportieren, wurden am Montag fur 83 Teams zum spektakularen Wintergeschoss. Zum ersten Mal mit dabei: Vierschanzentournee-Gewinner Sven Hannawald und der vierfache Bob-Olympiasieger Andre Lange. Warum die 25 Prozent Gefalle ausgerechnet den beiden Spitzensportlern √úberwindung abverlangen und was die beiden auch uber das Rennen hinaus verbindet, verraten sie bei Life. Kicken mit Krucken: Nicole Roos als einzige Frau im Amputierten-FuSSball Schon als 14jahrige spielte Nicole Roos beim FuSSball eine Klasse hoher bei den Jungs mit - doch dann der Schock: Es wird Knochenkrebs im rechten Knie diagnostiziert, der rechte Ober- und Unterschenkel mussten 2021 amputiert werden. Doch das halt sie nicht auf und sie findet einen neuen Verein. Und hier teilt die ganze Mannschaft ein Schicksal: allen musste ein Bein amputiert werden. Und dennoch spielen sie FuSSball - und zwar richtig gut! Bis zum Titel? Zuruck in die Zukunft: unkaputtbares DDR-Glas kommt neu auf den Markt Junge Unternehmer bringen eine nahezu vergessene DDR-Technologie zuruck: Glasflaschen, die selbst meterhohe Sturze auf Beton uberstehen. Entwickelt in den 80er Jahren, verschwand das Verfahren nach der Wende - aus Profitgrunden, denn nur wenn Glas kaputt geht, kann man neues verkaufen. "Wir wollen diesen Wahnsinn beenden", erklart Unternehmer Steve. Doch halt die Flasche wirklich, was sie verspricht?</desc>

<title>Loheratsur</title>
<desc>Kui te arvate, et lohed on maailmast kadunud, siis eksite rangalt. Nad elavad meie keskel ja lendavad m√µnikord hasti k√µrgel lennukite k√µrval. Olete marganud? Nagu meil, on ka neil unistused: nad usuvad, et leiavad kunagi oma esivanemate maa, imelise Taevaveere. Sellest imekaunist kohast on vaike lohepoeg Tuleloit kuulnud vanake Tuusthabemelt. Ja sellest peale pole ta lahti saanud uhest m√µttest: see maa tuleb ules leida! Liiguvad kuuldused, et lohede rohelisse orgu asuvad peagi inimesed elama. Nad raiuvad maha puud, ehitavad majad, v√µtavad neilt nende vaikse nurgakese ja siis... Siis kaovad lohed maailmast kindlasti. Unistaja Tuleloit ja tema metsahaldjast s√µbratar Oblik otsustavad astuda julge sammu - otsida Taevaveer ules, tulla tagasi koju ja juhatada k√µik lohed sinna.</desc>

<title>Politseilugu</title>
<desc>R: Jackie Chan, Chi-Hwa Chen. O: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung. Enam kui viiskummend aastat tagasi lapsnaitlejana filmi- ja telekarjaari alustanud ning Austraalias elanud ning seejarel kodumaale Hongkongi √µppima saadetud Jackie Chan oli 1980. aastateks t√µusnud uheks produktiivseimaks Aasia marulifilmide naitlejaks ja lavastajaks, kes uhtviisi oli n√µutud nii Hiina kui ka ingliskeelsel kinoturul. Tema 1985. aastal kinodes esilinastunud ja suurt kassat teeninud "Politselugude" saaga esimene paasuke palvis suurt tahelepanu ka kriitikute silmis, kes valisid linateose aasta parimaks Hongkongi mangufilmiks. Tegu oli Jackie Chani viienda lavastajatooga. Jackie Chan kehastab filmis Kevini-nimelist v√µmmi, kes saab ulesandeks vahistada kurikuulus narkoparun. Viimast ahvardab vangiminek ainult juhul, kui tema vastu annab tunnistusi tema ihusekretar (Brigitte Lin). Kevin saab uueks ulesandeks sekretari kuni kohtum√µistmiseni kaitsta. Kuigi narkoparuni ustavad abilised teevad k√µik, et ainsat tunnistajat "ara koristada", j√µuab asi siiski kohtusse. Suur on aga Kevini ullatus, kui hoopis teda suudistatakse ebaseaduslikus tegutsemises. Nuud peab mees valja m√µtlema plaani, kuidas suu endalt maha pesta, tudruks√µber tagasi v√µita ja kord majja luua. "Politseilugu", mida Jackie Chan ise peab oma rohkem kui 150 filmist koosnevast filmograafiast uheks lemmikuks, on saanud aastatega mitu √µnnestunud ja vahem √µnnestunud jarge, viimane neist valmis 2013. aastal. Kaasahaaravas mollukomoodias teeb Jackie tudruks√µbra rollis kaasa ka teine Hiina staar Maggie Cheung ("Valmis armastuseks", "Kangelane", "2046"), kellest sai esimene Aasiast parit naitlejanna, kes palvis filmi "Clean" eest (re≈æissoor Olivier Assayas) Cannesi festivalil parima naisosataitja preemia.</desc>

<title>Politseilugu</title>
<desc>R: Jackie Chan, Chi-Hwa Chen. O: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung. Enam kui viiskummend aastat tagasi lapsnaitlejana filmi- ja telekarjaari alustanud ning Austraalias elanud ning seejarel kodumaale Hongkongi √µppima saadetud Jackie Chan oli 1980. aastateks t√µusnud uheks produktiivseimaks Aasia marulifilmide naitlejaks ja lavastajaks, kes uhtviisi oli n√µutud nii Hiina kui ka ingliskeelsel kinoturul. Tema 1985. aastal kinodes esilinastunud ja suurt kassat teeninud "Politselugude" saaga esimene paasuke palvis suurt tahelepanu ka kriitikute silmis, kes valisid linateose aasta parimaks Hongkongi mangufilmiks. Tegu oli Jackie Chani viienda lavastajatooga. Jackie Chan kehastab filmis Kevini-nimelist v√µmmi, kes saab ulesandeks vahistada kurikuulus narkoparun. Viimast ahvardab vangiminek ainult juhul, kui tema vastu annab tunnistusi tema ihusekretar (Brigitte Lin). Kevin saab uueks ulesandeks sekretari kuni kohtum√µistmiseni kaitsta. Kuigi narkoparuni ustavad abilised teevad k√µik, et ainsat tunnistajat "ara koristada", j√µuab asi siiski kohtusse. Suur on aga Kevini ullatus, kui hoopis teda suudistatakse ebaseaduslikus tegutsemises. Nuud peab mees valja m√µtlema plaani, kuidas suu endalt maha pesta, tudruks√µber tagasi v√µita ja kord majja luua. "Politseilugu", mida Jackie Chan ise peab oma rohkem kui 150 filmist koosnevast filmograafiast uheks lemmikuks, on saanud aastatega mitu √µnnestunud ja vahem √µnnestunud jarge, viimane neist valmis 2013. aastal. Kaasahaaravas mollukomoodias teeb Jackie tudruks√µbra rollis kaasa ka teine Hiina staar Maggie Cheung ("Valmis armastuseks", "Kangelane", "2046"), kellest sai esimene Aasiast parit naitlejanna, kes palvis filmi "Clean" eest (re≈æissoor Olivier Assayas) Cannesi festivalil parima naisosataitja preemia.</desc>

<title>Politseilugu 2</title>
<desc>R: Jackie Chan. O: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung. Korduvalt k√µigi aegade parimate marulifilmide TOP 100 edetabelisse mahtunud "Politselugude" sarja teise osa keskseks tegelaseks on taas Jackie Chani kehastatav politseiuurija Kevin, keda esimeses osas suudistati ebaharilike v√µtete kasutamises. Nuud peab tarmukas uurija hoiduma v√µimuka kurjategija eest, kelle Kevin kunagi trellide taha saatis ja kes nuud vanglast vabanedes lubab katte maksta nii talle kui ka tema pruudile (Maggie Cheung). Lisaks k√µigele ahvardab kurjategijate kamp hakata suurlinnas hooneid √µhkima, kui neile ei maksta miljonitesse ulatuvaid summasid. Sel raskel hetkel vaatavad nii linna- kui ka politseiv√µimud otsa vaid uhele mehele - Kevinile -, kes on alati ka k√µige lootusetuna naivas olukorras valmis kastanid tulest valja tooma. Film kogus sarnaselt "Politseilugude" avaosaga suurt populaarsust ja Hongkongi filmiakadeemia valis selle taas parimaks kodumaiseks marulifilmiks. Filmis nahtavatest Jackie Chani kaelamurdvatest ja efektsetest trikkidest sai tema lahutamatu kaubamark pikkadeks aastateks.</desc>

<title>Politseilugu 2</title>
<desc>R: Jackie Chan. O: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung. Korduvalt k√µigi aegade parimate marulifilmide TOP 100 edetabelisse mahtunud "Politselugude" sarja teise osa keskseks tegelaseks on taas Jackie Chani kehastatav politseiuurija Kevin, keda esimeses osas suudistati ebaharilike v√µtete kasutamises. Nuud peab tarmukas uurija hoiduma v√µimuka kurjategija eest, kelle Kevin kunagi trellide taha saatis ja kes nuud vanglast vabanedes lubab katte maksta nii talle kui ka tema pruudile (Maggie Cheung). Lisaks k√µigele ahvardab kurjategijate kamp hakata suurlinnas hooneid √µhkima, kui neile ei maksta miljonitesse ulatuvaid summasid. Sel raskel hetkel vaatavad nii linna- kui ka politseiv√µimud otsa vaid uhele mehele - Kevinile -, kes on alati ka k√µige lootusetuna naivas olukorras valmis kastanid tulest valja tooma. Film kogus sarnaselt "Politseilugude" avaosaga suurt populaarsust ja Hongkongi filmiakadeemia valis selle taas parimaks kodumaiseks marulifilmiks. Filmis nahtavatest Jackie Chani kaelamurdvatest ja efektsetest trikkidest sai tema lahutamatu kaubamark pikkadeks aastateks.</desc>

<title>Auch mein FuSSball! Frauen im Stadion</title>
<desc>Die FuSSballwelt ist mannlich dominiert. Doch auch Frauen wollen ihre Freude am FuSSball und ihr Fansein ausleben. Nicht nur im Stadion sind sie mit ganz eigenen Herausforderungen konfrontiert. Immer mehr Madchen und Frauen begeistern sich fur Klubs und Stars. Aber ihren Platz auf der Tribune mussen sie sich erst erkampfen. Die Erfahrungen reichen von fehlender Anerkennung bis hin zu offenem Sexismus. Wie gehen sie damit um, wie uberwinden sie das? Sie drucken ihrem Lieblingsverein vor dem Bildschirm die Daumen und viele zieht es auch ins Stadion. Singen, jubeln und schimpfen - die emotionale Atmosphare zieht sie in den Bann. Sei es beim erfolgreichsten deutschen Klub, dem FC Bayern Munchen, oder in der vierten Liga, beim abgesturzten Traditionsverein MSV Duisburg. Ihre Leidenschaft fur die Bayern wurde Louisa (30) nicht in die Wiege gelegt: Ihr Vater halt zum VfB Stuttgart. Seit 2021 reist die alleinerziehende Mutter aus dem Allgau zu Heim- und Auswartsspielen, ist mittlerweile Mitglied in zwei Fanklubs. Doch gerade unter der Woche wird jeder Stadionbesuch zum Abenteuer: ein Ticket organisieren, Urlaub bekommen, eine Betreuung fur den Sohn finden, die Anreise planen. Und nach dem Spiel hofft Louisa, dass sie den letzten Zug erwischt. Laura (34) hat selbst als Profi in der ersten Bundesliga gespielt. Doch sie hat die FuSSballschuhe fur ihre wahre Leidenschaft an den Nagel gehangt: den MSV Duisburg anfeuern. Um dem Verein hinterherfahren zu konnen, hat sie ihre Karriere beendet. Seit uber zehn Jahren steht sie nun in der Kurve. Sie glaubt, alles gesehen zu haben, aber dann geht diese Saison ein Traum in Erfullung: Zum ersten Mal ist sie bei Zebra FM, dem Radiosender des MSV, als Gastkommentatorin dabei. Das harte Fan-Dasein in der vierten Liga und das Ruhrgebiet konnten nicht weiter entfernt sein vom Champagner-FuSSball in der Munchner Allianz Arena. Und doch haben Louisa und Laura eine Gemeinsamkeit: Sie wissen, wie schwer es ist, sich als weibliche Fans die Anerkennung zu erarbeiten, die fur Manner selbstverstandlich ist. Und sie kennen die groSSen Herausforderungen, mit denen Frauen im Stadion noch immer konfrontiert sind. Aber davon lassen sie sich nicht beeindrucken. "37¬∞Leben - Auch mein FuSSball! Frauen im Stadion" ist ab dem 10. Januar 2025 in der ZDFmediathek abrufbar.</desc>

<title>Frauen in der Armutsfalle</title>
<sub-title>Frauen in der Armutsfalle: Viel Arbeit, wenig Lohn</sub-title>
<desc>Frauen verdienen im Job immer noch weniger als Manner. Zusatzlich schmeiSSen sie noch den Haushalt, erziehen Kinder und pflegen Angehorige. Ihr Armutsrisiko im Alter wird vollig unterschatzt. Viele Frauen kummern sich zu wenig um ihre Finanzen. Rund 70 Prozent der heute berufstatigen Frauen furchten, sich im Alter drastisch einschranken zu mussen. Hilde Fromm ist wutend. √úber die gesellschaftliche Ungerechtigkeit, dass sie ihr Leben lang fur ihre Arbeit generell schlechter bezahlt wurde als Manner. Aber auch uber sich selbst, weil die 68-Jahrige sich immer zu wenig Gedanken uber ihre finanzielle Situation gemacht hat. "√úber Geld spricht man nicht, sagte man fruher. So wurde ich erzogen, und so habe ich es ein Leben lang gehalten." Diese Sprachlosigkeit hat jedoch krasse Folgen: Als Rentnerin kommt Hilde Fromm finanziell kaum uber die Runden. Unterstutzung findet sie beim Verein Lebenshilfe e. V. Hier bekommt sie regelmaSSig Einkaufsgutscheine, eine warme Mahlzeit und trifft Frauen, denen es genauso geht wie ihr. Mandy Mewes und Jana Schutze befinden sich in der Mitte des Lebens. Das heiSSt vor allem eins: viel Arbeit. "Haushalt, Familie, Job - Sitzen tue ich eigentlich nur, wenn ich esse", berichtet Jana. Die 51-Jahrige arbeitete fruher als OP-Assistenz. Doch mit inzwischen vier Kindern, zwei Hunden und einem vollzeitarbeitendem Ehemann musste sie ihre Arbeitszeit einschranken. Der neue Teilzeitjob als Sterilisationsassistentin bringt rund 50 Prozent weniger Gehalt. Das hat drastische Auswirkungen auf Janas Rentenniveau. "Das macht man sich erstmal gar nicht klar, was Teilzeit fur langfristige Folgen hat." Mandy Mewes droht die Armut nicht erst im Alter, sondern schon jetzt. Die heute 47-Jahrige war jahrelang Gutverdienerin mit Dienstwagen, regelmaSSigen Urlaubsreisen und schicker Wohnung. Mit der Geburt ihrer Tochter und der Trennung vom Partner kam der finanzielle Absturz: "Wir mussen jeden Cent zweimal umdrehen. Ein Besuch im Eiscafe ist fur mich heute ein kaum bezahlbarer Luxus." Studentin Laura Stuhldreier will gar nicht erst in eine solche Situation kommen. "Wenns um die eigenen Finanzen geht, sollte jede Frau selbst aktiv werden", findet die 22-Jahrige. Jeden Monat legt sie kleinste Betrage ihres Studentenbudgets in Aktien an. Was erstmal nach sehr wenig aussieht rechnet sich langfristig sehr wohl.
