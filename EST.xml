<desc>Die Journalistin Nora Sand erkampft sich Zugang zu den Akten des Vermisstenfalls Lisbeth und Lulu aus den 80er Jahren. Durch ihre akribische Recherche stoSSt sie auf einen moglichen Verdachtigen: Kurt Damtoft, der Handballtrainer der verschwundenen Madchen, war von der Polizei zwar fruhzeitig als Tater ausgeschlossen worden, doch Noras Nachforschungen bringen dunkle Geheimnisse aus seiner Vergangenheit ans Licht, die seine Unschuld infrage stellen. Als Nora Damtoft ihn ausfindig macht und zur Rede stellt, beteuert er seine Unschuld. Doch Nora bleibt uberzeugt, dass er etwas verheimlicht, und beschlieSSt, ihre Erkenntnisse offentlich zu machen. Sie verfasst einen Artikel fur die Lokalzeitung, in dem sie die damalige Polizeiarbeit scharf kritisiert und Damtoft an den Pranger stellt. Trotz der feindseligen Reaktionen aus den Reihen der ortlichen Polizei und ihrer eigenen Kollegen verfolgt Nora den Fall unbeirrt weiter. Plotzlich steht nicht nur die Vergangenheit im Fokus, sondern auch die dringende Frage, ob Damtoft etwas mit dem Verschwinden der jungen Sofia zu tun hat, die wenige Tage zuvor nicht nach Hause kam ...</desc>

<sub-title>Norwegen: Ruckkehr zu den Enteninseln</sub-title>
<desc>Im Vega-Archipel, hoch im Norden Norwegens am Polarkreis, ist die Natur karg. Die Menschen lebten hier jahrhundertlang als Fischer und Bauern und sind mit wilden Eiderenten eine einmalige Partnerschaft eingegangen. Der Vega-Archipel mit seinen uber 6.000 Inseln ist das Reich der Eiderenten. Sie kommen jedes Jahr hierhin, um in den flachen Gewassern Nahrung zu finden und sich zu paaren. Doch auf den kahlen Inseln sind ihre Eier und Kuken auch immer dem Wetter und Fressfeinden wie Mowen und Adlern ausgesetzt. Die Inselbewohner bieten den Enten einen einmaligen Schutz: Schon seit Hunderten von Jahren bauen sie unzahlige Verschlage aus Treibholz, kleine Hauser aus Stein und Nistplatze unter ihren Wohnhausern. Dort konnen die Vogel sicher bruten. Als Gegenleistung ernten die Menschen am Ende der Brutsaison die kostbaren Eiderdaunen, mit denen die Enten ihre Nester ausgepolstert haben. Die Federn sind wegen ihrer extrem hohen Isolationskraft und der groSSen Haltbarkeit ein begehrter Rohstoff. Um eine Daunendecke zu fullen, die dann fur mehrere Tausend Euro verkauft wird, braucht es Daunen aus 60 bis 70 Nestern. Diese Lebensweise, die auch die Natur der Inseln gepragt hat, ist in Gefahr. Denn das Leben im Archipel ist einsam und hart. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten haben die meisten Bewohner die Inseln verlassen. Nur noch wenige von Ihnen kummern sich im Sommer um die Enten. Doch es gibt Hoffnung: Seit 2004 ist Vega wegen der einmaligen Symbiose von Mensch und Tier UNESCO-Welterbe - und eine neue Generation junger Norweger engagiert sich im Archipel.</desc>

<desc>(1): In Litauen: Haikus erzahlen die Deportation 1940 besetzte die Sowjetunion Litauen. Um jegliche Widerstandsversuche zu unterdrucken, verhaftete und verschleppte die Geheimpolizei 1941 zehntausende Litauer in sibirische Arbeitslager. Die "Feinde des Volkes" wurden mit ihren Frauen und Kindern abtransportiert. Die litauische Schriftstellerin Jurga Vilƒó erzahlt ihre Geschichte in der Graphic Novel Sibiro Haiku. Sie beschreibt darin den langen Weg der Angst, des Hungers und der Trennung aus der Perspektive ihres Vaters, damals ein Kind. (2): Telenovelas: Eine brasilianische Leidenschaft Jeden Abend begeistern sich in Brasilien Millionen fur ihr Lieblingsprogramm: die Telenovela. Dreiecksbeziehungen, Eifersucht, Verrat, Geheimnisse, Spannung und uberraschende Wendungen - die Serien triefen vor Klischees. Der besondere Reiz dieser Mischung aus Latino-Drama, Erfolgstraum und taglichem Leben ruhrt von den AuSSendrehs und einem gesellschaftlichen Aktualitatsbezug. (3): Im Oman: Mohammeds Kamelfleisch mit Kurkuma und Chili In der Wuste von Rimal Al Wahiba bereitet Mohammed Kamelfleisch zu, ein traditionelles und beliebtes Gericht der Beduinen. Erst wird das Fleisch mit Knoblauch und gestampftem Chili gekocht, dann kommen Pfeffer, Kurkuma und Wasser hinzu. Nach einer Stunde Schmoren auf kleiner Flamme wird das sehr gesunde Gericht mit Butterreis serviert. (4): In Texas: Ein Gericht fur den Prasidenten Sogar der Name der texanischen Stadt San Antonio erinnert an ihre mexikanische Vergangenheit.

Hier lebt die Schriftstellerin, die 1969 geboren wurde, seit 2020 auch mit ihrer Partnerin, der Philosophin Beatriz Preciado. In ihrem 2010 veroffentlichten Kriminalroman  ∫Apokalypse Baby ∫ lasst Despentes kein gutes Haar an der Heteronormativitat. Sie entfuhrt ihre Leser in die rebellische Welt der katalanischen Randgruppen, der feministischen sexpositiven Milieus, der AuSSenseiter und der extremen Gewalt. (2): Metal, Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks Finnland ist eine Hochburg des Metal. Schatzungen zufolge kommen etwa 53 Metal-Bands auf 100.000 Einwohner, insgesamt fast 3.000 im ganzen Land. Die energiegeladene Musikrichtung zehrt von den kulturellen Wurzeln des beschaulichen nordischen Landes und hat sich zum Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks entwickelt. In den 1980er-Jahren traf der im Vereinigten Konigreich entstandene Metal auf ein Finnland, das von seinen sowjetischen Nachbarn nicht nur politisch isoliert gehalten wurde. Nach dem Fall der Sowjetunion sturzten sich die Finnen regelrecht auf diese Musik, die die Erinnerung an ihre Legenden und Mythen wachhalt.

Der Koch gibt sie in einen Dampfgarer, schneidet anschlieSSend Gurken, Zwiebeln und Tomaten und besprenkelt diese mit frischer Kokosmilch. SchlieSSlich kommen die gegarten Bananenscheiben dazu - ein simples und typisches Gericht aus dem pazifischen Raum.

<title>Die Muscheltaucherinnen vom Kongo-Delta</title>
<desc>Mitten im Delta des Kongo-Flusses liegt eine Insel, Kizunga Manianga. Sie ist umgeben von maandernden Flussarmen und verwunschenen Mangrovenwaldern. Hier leben und arbeiten Muscheltaucherinnen, das Tauchen ist im Fluss-Delta traditionell Frauensache. Die Taucherinnen tragen hohe Verantwortung: Ihre Familien sind auf die Ertrage angewiesen; und weil der Fischfang zuruckgeht, sind viele Manner fort, um anderswo Geld zu verdienen. Die Muscheln sind fur viele Familien die Rettung. Marie Velakutshi taucht fast jeden Tag bis zu 150 Mal im truben Wasser, bis ihre Pirogen voll sind. Die Frauen tauchen bei Ebbe, dann ist das Wasser etwa drei Meter tief; sie haben dabei nur eine Sicht von wenigen Zentimetern. Denn der Kongo ist ein tropischer Schwarzwasserfluss, eingeschwemmte Huminstoffe aus Mooren und humushaltigen Regenwaldboden farben ihn dunkel. Tuckisch ist aber vor allem die starke Stromung, eine der starksten der Welt. Wenn Marie zu lange unter Wasser bleibt, treibt sie ab und muss mit dem Fang in den Handen gegen die Stromung anschwimmen, was manchmal schier unmoglich ist. Die Taucherinnen sind deswegen stets an einer Rettungsleine festgemacht. Demnachst sollen die Muscheln, die von den Frauen nicht zur Eigenversorgung gebraucht werden, auf dem Markt in der Stadt verkauft werden, wo Marie auch ihre beiden Tochter besuchen mochte. Sie sind bei Verwandten untergebracht, damit sie dort zur Schule gehen konnen. Marie mochte vermeiden, dass die beiden eines Tages Muscheltaucherinnen werden mussen.</desc>

Jeden Tag steht er zwischen funf und halb sechs Uhr auf, er treibt wochentlich Sport und lernt sogar noch eine neue Sprache. Doch Hans-Joachim Petzke ist kein gewohnlicher Rentner: Er ist einer der sogenannten Super-Ager, deren Geheimnis am Deutschen Zentrum fur Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen in Magdeburg erforscht wird. Auf der Suche nach Menschen wie Petzke untersucht das Team um Studienleiterin Dr. Anne Maass und Beate Schumann-Werner hunderte von Probanden ab dem 60. Lebensjahr. Ob jemand wirklich ein Super-Ager ist, wird vor allem mit kognitiven Tests ermittelt. Die 86-jahrige Gisela Opitz hat sich als Studienteilnehmerin gemeldet. Sie arbeitet taglich daran, ihr Gehirn fit zu halten. Als Ehrenamtliche fuhrt sie Besuchergruppen durch den Magdeburger Dom ‚Äì und versucht, jede noch so komplexe Frage zu beantworten. Sie ist sich sicher: "Das trainiert mein Gehirn und so rostet es nicht ein". Doch ist auch sie eine Super-Agerin? Wahrend viele Menschen sich fragen, wie lange sie zukunftig arbeiten werden oder 60-Jahrige bereits vom Vorruhestand traumen, sind andere im hohen Alter sogar noch berufstatig. Doch wann ist es ratsam, altersbedingt kurzer zu treten? Walter Spielkamp aus Stuttgart ist 82 Jahre alt und Statiker.

Die Gesang und Instrumente vereinende Musik ist alter als Jazz, Blues, Gospel und sogar die Gesange der Sklaven auf den nordamerikanischen Plantagen. Im Senegal besinnt sich der Jazz auf seine Wurzeln vor dem Exil, zuruck zu den Vorfahren. So klingt die Musik der Befreiung.

Durch die Begegnung mit der lokalen Bevolkerung und ihren Traditionen entdeckte er eine neue Art der Spiritualitat, die ihn pragen sollte, und die er mit dem fur ihn typischen Zynismus in Reiseberichten festhielt. (2): Guatemala: Vom Mais gesegnet Mais wird in vielen Dorfern im Osten Guatemalas bei einer Zeremonie zu Ehren des Gottes Yum Kaax als heilige Pflanze verehrt. Fur die Nachfahren der Maya steht das Getreide, das dort in vier verschiedenen Arten existiert, fur die Verbindung zwischen Leben, Himmel und Erde. Seit der Antike wird Mais in groSSem Stil angebaut - im Dschungel wie am FuSSe der Berge. Die Tradition besteht bis heute fort und macht den Reichtum des Landes aus.

Als ware das nicht genug, stehen plotzlich auch noch zwei zwielichtige Gestalten in seinem Versicherungsburo: Traumchen und Schmied, zwei Schrottis aus Mirkos Heimat.

Unversehens findet sich Mirko mit blutiger Nase auf dem Bock eines Lasters wieder, der ihn in die Heimat zurucktransportiert. Er erfahrt, dass sein Vater Fiete gestorben ist und ihm den Schrottplatz hinterlassen hat zusammen mit seinem jungeren Bruder Letscho, der immer noch stinksauer ist, dass Mirko die Familie im Stich gelassen hat. Dieser will so schnell wie moglich wieder weg. Doch tritt nach Fietes Beerdigung der Unternehmer Wolfgang Kercher an ihn heran, der schon lange scharf auf den Schrottplatz der Talhammers ist.

<sub-title>Kawah Ijen: Inmitten der Schwefelholle</sub-title>
<desc>Indonesien gehort mit seinen 147 aktiven Vulkanen zur vulkanreichsten Region der Erde. Der besonders faszinierende Vulkan Ijen, im Osten der Insel Java, bildet den Gegensatz zum satten Grun der Walder in der Region: Karges Gestein und giftige Schwefeldampfe umgeben Arnaud, als er den Felsriesen erklimmt. Inmitten des Vulkans befindet sich der jadegrun leuchtende Kratersee Kawah Ijen, einer der saurehaltigsten Seen der Welt. Weder Tiere noch Mikroorganismen konnen in diesem sauren Milieu leben. Der Vulkan stoSSt standig Gaswolken aus, die bei Arnaud zu einem Brennen im Rachen und einem Hustenreiz fuhren. Das stort die Bergarbeiter schon langst nicht mehr: Taglich steigen die "starken Manner Javas" in den Krater, um dort Schwefel abzubauen, und das ohne Schutzkleidung. Seit 28 Jahren macht Sarno diesem Namen alle Ehre, den Arnaud bei seiner strapaziosen Arbeit inmitten der dampfenden Holle begleitet. Mit einer Art Brecheisen haut Sarno das Schwefelerz aus dem Gestein und schleppt das gelbe Gold die steilen Kraterwande hoch - pro Tag bis zu 150 Kilogramm. Die Arbeit ist nicht nur hart, sondern auch gefahrlich: Auf dem Grund des Kratersees konnen sich riesige hochgiftige Gasblasen bilden, die aufsteigen und an der Oberflache explodieren - eine todliche Falle. Auch die umliegende Bevolkerung ist von diesem "Saurefass" bedroht: Das saure Seewasser gelangt in die Flusse und stellt eine groSSe Gefahr fur die Bevolkerung, die landwirtschaftlichen Kulturen und die Boden dar. Rund 10.000 Menschen haben keinen Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser und kampfen mit gravierenden Gesundheitsproblemen. Als die Sonne untergeht, bietet sich Arnaud ein besonderer Anblick: Aus dem Krater des Ijen zungeln meterhohe blaue Flammen in die Lufte. Das spektakulare Naturschauspiel verbildlicht die Aktivitat dieses Vulkans, die fur die Menschen Einnahmequelle und Gesundheitsrisiko zugleich bedeutet.</desc>

<sub-title>Ecuador: Hoffnung fur die Nebelwalder</sub-title>
<desc>Sie gehoren zu den spektakularsten Landschaften der Erde: die Nebelwalder in den Anden Ecuadors. Hier wachsen Hunderte Baumarten, auf ihnen farbenprachtige Bromelien und Orchideen. Auch die Tierwelt ist einzigartig. Ob Vogel, groSSe Raubtiere, Frosche oder Insekten: Die Vielfalt der Formen und Farben ist uberwaltigend. Diese paradiesischen Nebelwalder sind in Gefahr. Vor allem durch die Viehwirtschaft, der immer groSSere Waldgebiete weichen mussen. Dabei wirft die harte Arbeit der Farmer kaum Gewinne ab. Doch es gibt Menschen, die das Abholzen der Nebelwalder aufhalten wollen. Einige Andengemeinden haben inzwischen ein anderes Auskommen gefunden - mit der Natur. Sie wollen die verbliebenen Nebelwalder nicht nur schutzen, sondern forsten sie wieder auf. Denn intakte Walder, schillernde Kolibris und wilde Brillenbaren locken Touristen und Wissenschaftler an. Die Besucher bescheren den Dorfbewohnern ein sicheres Einkommen, und der Wald bleibt erhalten. Der Film begleitet Barenschutzer, von der Natur faszinierte Farmer und Wissenschaftler, die um das √úberleben seltener Froscharten und der riesigen Insektenvielfalt kampfen. Alle eint dasselbe Ziel: Ecuadors Nebelwalder sollen auch auSSerhalb von Nationalparks erhalten bleiben. Das gelingt, wenn die Menschen vom Erhalt der Walder profitieren. Ein Vorbild fur andere Regionen der Welt, wo der Wald der Viehwirtschaft weichen muss.</desc>

<sub-title>Bodensee - Rettung fur die Vogelwelt</sub-title>
<desc>Der Bodensee ist eines der groSSten und schonsten Binnengewasser Mitteleuropas. Seit Jahrtausenden ist die Region fur ihre fruchtbaren Boden bekannt. Schon vor 4.000 Jahren wurden an den Ufern √Ñpfel geerntet ‚Äî heute sind die Weine aus den Spitzenlagen der Region weltberuhmt. Doch der Erfolg der industrialisierten Landwirtschaft mit ihren Monokulturen fordert seinen Tribut: Die Vogelwelt ist in den letzten 50 Jahren dramatisch geschrumpft. Rund 65 Prozent aller heimischen Vogel sind verschwunden. Der Ornithologe Prof. Peter Berthold kennt den Grund dafur. √úberall, wo groSSflachig und intensiv Landwirtschaft betrieben wird, haben Vogel und andere Wildtiere wichtige Lebensraume verloren. Es fehlen naturliche Nahrungsquellen wie Wildkrauter, Blutenpflanzen und Insekten. Im Jahr 2003 begann Peter Berthold, dem Vogelsterben aktiv entgegenzuwirken ‚Äî mit einem simplen wie genialen Plan. Ein engmaschiges Netzwerk aus neu angelegten Weihern, Hecken, Schilfgurteln und Streuobstwiesen soll Vogeln und anderen Wildtieren zuruckgeben, was sie zum Leben brauchen. Alles in direkter Nachbarschaft zu Ortschaften und den landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flachen. Der Film begleitet dieses einzigartige Projekt, in dem inzwischen zahlreiche Naturschutzer, Bauern und Gemeinden zusammenarbeiten. Er zeigt anhand aufwendiger Tierbilder und Luftaufnahmen, wie WeiSSstorche, Waldrappe und seltene Singvogel in eine Region zuruckkehren, aus der sie lange verschwunden waren.</desc>

<sub-title>WeiSS - Von Tianzhus Schneebergen in die Wuste Gobi</sub-title>
<desc>Jedes Jahr wenn die Kraniche kommen, nimmt sich der Maler Hu Zetao eine Auszeit und zieht sich in das Flussdelta des Shuangtaizi zuruck. Die schwarz-weiSSen Mandschurenkraniche gehoren zu den wichtigsten Vogeln in der chinesischen Mythologie - sie symbolisieren Bestandigkeit und ein langes Leben. "Auf einem Kranich ins Paradies des Westens fliegen, sagen wir, wenn wir das Sterben und die Unsterblichkeit meinen." erklart der Maler. In der uralten Philosophie des Wu Xing, dem Kreis der funf Elemente, gehoren die untergehende Sonne, der Westen, die Ernte und die Farbe WeiSS zusammen. Auch mit der Zeit der Trauer ist die Farbe verbunden. Ein Grund dafur, warum WeiSS fur traditionell denkende Chinesen und Chinesinnen auch nicht auf eine Hochzeit, sondern eher auf eine Beerdigung gehort. Das Element der Farbe WeiSS ist das Metall. Feng Shaoxing ist einer der renommiertesten Porzellanmeister des Landes. Er findet, dass das makellose WeiSS von Porzellan auf Menschen eine beruhigende Wirkung hat. Und: die Herstellung seines Porzellans ist untrennbar mit den funf Elementen verbunden: "Die Basis ist Porzellanerde. Sie ist voller Metalloxide. Es wird Wasser zum Formen des Rohlings und fur die Glasur genutzt. Das Feuer des Ofens brennt mit Kiefernholz. Also sind alle funf Elemente vereint: Erde, Metall, Wasser, Holz und Feuer."</desc>

<sub-title>Schwarz - Vom Feng-Shui Dorf zum Eis des schwarzen Drachenflusses</sub-title>
<desc>Wenige Lander haben so gegensatzliche Wetterextreme vorzuweisen wie China: von Wustenhitze uber tropisch-feuchte Gegenden bis hin zur subarktischen Zone. Hier, in der nordlichsten Region Chinas, liegt Mohe. Direkt am Heilongjiang, dem "Schwarzen Drachenfluss", der Grenze zu Russland. Im Norden Chinas sind die Winter lang: Bis Mai ist der Fluss meist zugefroren und der erste Schnee kommt schon Ende September. Die Himmelsrichtung Norden ist in China mit der Farbe Schwarz verbunden, auch der Winter, die Zeit der Regeneration. Die Natur kann ruhen und Kraft sammeln, bevor der Kreislauf des Lebens erneut beginnt. Veranderung und Wandel sind Grundprinzipien in der uralten Lehre der funf Elemente. Das Element der Farbe Schwarz ist das Wasser, die Grundlage allen Lebens, Symbol ruhiger Beharrlichkeit. Wasser hat in China von jeher einen groSSen Einfluss auf den Stadtebau gehabt, so auch im 900 Jahre alten Dorf Hongcun in der Provinz Anhui. Es wurde nach den Regeln des Feng Shui errichtet, im harmonischen Einklang mit der naturlichen Umgebung. Die Dacher der Hauser sind schwarz gedeckt - ein symbolischer Schutz gegen Feuer. Schwarz und WeiSS liegen eng beieinander in der chinesischen Philosophie: Die Dunkelheit umfangt den Tag. Weich und hart, oben und unten, schwer und leicht: Gegensatze bringen das Leben in Bewegung. Im Yin und Yang Zeichen ist dieser Grundgedanke symbolisiert. In der sanften Kampfkunst Tai Chi sind Ausgewogenheit und Balance von Yin und Yang die Basis aller Bewegungsablaufe.</desc>

Die Eltern haben in Griechenland aber auch eigene Plane: Sie wollen am neuen Wohnort ein Erholungszentrum fur Pflegefamilien errichten und besichtigen dafur einen Olivenhain, der zum Verkauf steht. "Wir glauben, dass Pflegefamilien der Austausch untereinander hilft. Man fuhlt sich namlich oft ziemlich alleine", sagt Jana.

<title>Ein tschechoslowakisches Marchen</title>
<desc>Fur Christian Paigneau war die Begegnung mit der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle wie Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Funf Jahre lang sah er sich samtliche Filme an, ohne auch nur ein Wort zu verstehen - aber die Bilder sprachen ihn an. Ihm wurde klar, dass die Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher gelernt hatten, sich mehr durch Bilder auszudrucken als durch Worte, weil sie in einem totalitaren Regime lebten. Genau darin liegt die Kraft der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle. Diese Filme finden immer einen Weg, ihre Botschaft zu ubermitteln, zum Beispiel durch ein Gefuhl oder eine bestimmte Atmosphare. Es entsteht ein intensiver Dialog mit dem Zuschauer. Milan Kundera erzahlte Paigneau von seiner Zeit als Dozent an der Film- und Fernsehfakultat der Akademie der musischen Kunste in Prag (FAMU). Die Fakultat, die zahlreiche Mitglieder der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle hervorbrachte, war damals ein freigeistiger Ort und forderte die Entstehung einer Gegenkultur. Doch die Geschichte hat auch ihre Schattenseiten: Filme, die uber 20 Jahre hinweg verboten waren, Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher im Exil, eine gespaltene Kinokultur zwischen Tschechien und der Slowakei und die Frage, warum zahlreiche Meisterwerke im Westen lange nicht gezeigt werden konnten. Der Dokumentarfilm erzahlt die Geschichte einer gescheiterten Filmbewegung. Er handelt vom geteilten Schicksal der Filmschaffenden und ihrem Verhaltnis zur Zensur. Gleichzeitig wird die Bewegung durch die Laufbahn des jungen Schriftstellers Jan Prochazka - einer der bekanntesten Personlichkeiten des Prager Fruhlings - von einer anderen Seite beleuchtet. Die einen uben mit ihren Filmen scharfe Regimekritik, der andere ist Mitglied im Zentralkomitee der Kommunistischen Partei und will das System von innen heraus verandern.

<sub-title>Auvergne: Die Geheimnisse der schlafenden Riesen</sub-title>
<desc>Idyllisch und friedlich - so scheint das Leben in der Auvergne. Seit etwa 10.000 Jahren sind hier die Vulkane erloschen, doch in ihnen schlummern noch immer Geheimnisse. Diesen will Arnaud Guerin zusammen mit dem Vulkanforscher Pierre Boivin auf den Grund gehen. Zuerst geht es die Luft: An Bord eines HeiSSluftballons fliegen sie uber die prachtige Vulkankette Cha√Æne des Puys. Vor 8.600 Jahren brach hier zum letzten Mal ein Vulkan aus - doch vielleicht brodelt es hier inzwischen wieder: Kurzlich wurden bedeutende Magmavorrate in der Tiefe entdeckt, die einen erneuten Ausbruch denkbar machen. Die nachste Station auf der Reise fuhrt Arnaud in das Bergmassiv Monts Dore, in dem sich ein sagenumwobener Kratersee befindet: der Lac Pavin. Aufgrund seiner vulkanischen Aktivitaten galt er fruher als verflucht. Von der Luft ubers Wasser geht es nun unter die Erde: Arnaud und Pierre lassen sich uber 25 Meter in die Tiefe der Grotte Creux de Soucy abseilen. Dort unten konnen sie die vulkanische Geschichte der Umgebung nachzeichnen. Pierre ist sich sicher, es wird einen neuen Ausbruch geben, die Frage ist nur wann. Auch heute schon birgt das erloschene Vulkangebiet Risiken: Arnaud wagt sich in die Grotte du Chien, in der eine hohe Kohlendioxidkonzentration herrscht. Auf Kopfhohe besteht keine Gefahr, doch am Boden wurde man bereits nach einer Viertelstunde ersticken. Weniger gefahrlich, dafur umso schoner ist die Felskirche Saint-Michel dAiguilhe, die auf einem Vulkanschlot in 90 Meter Hohe thront. Die Idylle der Auvergne lasst vergessen, dass die Feuerriesen nur schlafen - jederzeit konnten sie wieder erwachen.</desc>

Zu Sinatras bekanntesten Liedern zahlen "My Way" (1968), "New York, New York" (1979) und "Fly Me to the Moon" (Cover-Version 1964). Seine markante Stimme bringt ihm den Spitznamen "The Voice" ein. Nicht nur als Sanger, sondern auch auf der Leinwand erlangt Sinatra Weltruhm. Fur seine Rolle in "Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit" erhalt er 1954 einen Oscar. Die Dokumentation wirft einen Blick auf das "goldene Zeitalter" der USA und den gleichzeitigen kometenhaften Aufstieg Sinatras mit all seinen Licht- und Schattenseiten. Von New York und Los Angeles uber Palm Springs bis zum Lake Tahoe folgt sie den Spuren eines Ausnahmekunstlers, der den amerikanischen Traum verkorperte. Aus zahlreichen Archivaufnahmen, alten Plattencovern und Plakaten sowie Musik- und Filmausschnitten entsteht ein lebendiges Portrat des Entertainers, dessen Charme unter anderen Ava Gardner, Lauren Bacall und Mia Farrow verfielen. Auch Sinatras Freundschaft zu John F. Kennedy wird thematisiert, die durch die angeblichen Verbindungen des Crooners zur Mafia uberschattet wurde. Und naturlich die Arbeit mit groSSen Regisseuren wie Otto Preminger, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Vincente Minnelli, Frank Capra oder Stanley Kramer, denen der Star einen GroSSteil seiner Filmografie verdankt.</desc>

<title>Yabusame, Japans Samurai-Ladys</title>
<desc>Ayuko Kamimura gehort zu den besten Yabusame-Schutzen der Welt. Seit ihr Vater vor 22 Jahren Yabusame als Sport neu erfunden hat, ist die 51-Jahrige dabei. Ayuko, von allen Amy genannt, ist die erste und bislang einzige Frau, die selbst von den erzkonservativen mannlichen Bewahrern der religiosen Yabusame-Zeremonien als Lehrmeisterin anerkannt wird. Ihr Bogen ist knapp zwei Meter lang. Nirgendwo sonst auf der Welt nutzen berittene Schutzen so lange Bogen. Einmal im Jahr organisiert sie das Sakura-Turnier, das einzige reine Frauen-Event im Yabusame-Sport. In diesem Jahr will sie dort zum letzten Mal vor groSSem Publikum auftreten, bevor sie den Platz fur talentierte Amazonen der jungen Generation raumt. Die Regeln fur den Wettkampf sind genau vorgeschrieben: Fur eine 100 Meter lange Strecke darf Amy maximal zwolf Sekunden brauchen. Drei Mal muss sie dabei auf eine Scheibe schieSSen. Treffer, Zeit und Eleganz entscheiden uber den Sieg. Die Trainingsstunden vor dem Wettkampf sind auch ein Testlauf fur Amys beste Schulerinnen. Die Suche nach einer Nachfolgerin liegt ihr besonders am Herzen. Die 20-jahrige Aoi Fuse hatte das Zeug zu einer Samurai-Meisterin der nachsten Generation. Funf Mal hat sie bereits den Titel in der hochsten Klasse, der Profiliga, gewonnen. Aber behalt sie auch in diesem Jahr die Nerven, wenn es um alles geht? Ausnahmetalent Eri Sakuraba dagegen wird im Fruhling zum ersten Mal in der Profiliga antreten. In den unteren Klassen hat die 14-Jahrige schon als Grundschulerin alle Pokale abgeraumt. Wie aber wird sie bei ihrem ersten groSSen Wettkampf abschneiden? Ganz egal, welche Reiterin am Ende den Preis mit nach Hause nimmt - es wird auf jeden Fall ein groSSer Tag fur die Samurai-Ladys Japans.</desc>

<sub-title>Ein Palast aus Sand: Nepals magische Mandalas</sub-title>
<desc>Im Westen der tibetischen Hauptstadt Kathmandu steht die Thrangu Tara Abbey, ein Kloster, in dem rund 230 Nonnen arbeiten und studieren. Sie gehoren einem der vier groSSen tibetischen Orden an - dem Karma-Kagyu-Orden. Seit 2016 erleben tibetisch-buddhistische Nonnen so etwas wie eine Revolution: Sie gelten als gleichgestellt gegenuber den Monchen - den Mannern des Ordens - und durfen Buddhas Lehre an klostereigenen Universitaten studieren. Wenn das mannliche und das weibliche Prinzip miteinander in volliger Harmonie sind - so der buddhistische Glaube - kann daraus Frieden erwachsen. Viele Nonnen sind Waisen oder stammen aus armlichen Regionen. Im Kloster erhalten sie kostenlos Essen und Bildung - wie Ani Jamyang. Das Kloster ist ihre Heimat geworden. Alle Hingabe der Nonnen gilt aktuell dem Wohl ihres jungst verstorbenen Meisters Thrangu Rinpoche. In allen Klostern des Karma-Kagye-Ordens finden derzeit intensive Gebetszeremonien statt. Sie sollen die Wiedergeburt des Meisters begleiten - die nach Vorstellung der Glaubigen demnachst bevorsteht. Die Nonnen der Thrangu Tara Abbey wollen ihren Teil dazu beitragen und im Tempel ein Schutz-Mandala errichten - aus farbigem Sand. Mit der Fertigstellung residiert Gottin Vajrayogini - so die Vorstellung der Glaubigen - in ihrem Sandmandala-Palast. Nach einer Woche, so sind die Glaubigen uberzeugt, wird sie wieder ausziehen. Danach wird das Mandala rituell zerstort. Diese Sichtweise fasst einen der Kerngedanken des Buddhismus zusammen: Nichts wahrt ewig. Deshalb sollte man fruh lernen, alles woran das Herz hangt, auch wieder loszulassen.</desc>

Im urwuchsigen Norden beeindruckt ein erloschener Vulkan. Heimische Schildkroten und eingewanderte Affen bevolkern die tropische Natur. Menschen entlang der Strecke machen mit ihrer Kultur und den Brauchen vertraut. Zu Ostern lassen sie Drachen steigen und bereiten aus SuSSkartoffeln Conkies zu. Neben den Klangen von Steeldrums ist auch ein beruhmtes Kirchenlied mit St. Kitts verbunden: John Newton beteiligte sich hier am Sklavenhandel und schrieb spater gelautert "Amazing Grace".</desc>

<title>Der Blauling und die neue Wildnis - Das Mangfallgebirge</title>
<desc>Extensiv genutzte Bergregionen bieten im Mangfallgebirge oft letzte Zuflucht fur vom Aussterben bedrohte Tier- und Pflanzenarten. In lichten, beweideten Bergwaldern balzen noch Auerhuhner, seit Jahrhunderten gehegte Feuchtwiesen bieten Ersatz fur entwasserte Moore. Auch fur den Fortbestand der in Bayern vom Aussterben bedrohten Birkhuhner werden im Mangfallgebirge groSSe Anstrengungen unternommen. Sie sollen hier den Platz bekommen, der ihnen im Flachland genommen wurde. Traditionell gemahte und beweidete Almwiesen sind auch Lebensraum fur Insekten, die woanders langst verschwunden sind. Nicht nur das Offenhalten der Walder und der richtigen Mahzeitpunkt auf den Almwiesen sind entscheidend, auch auf die sanfte Beweidung durch Kuhe, Schafe und Ziegen kommt es an. So entstehen eine neue Wildnis und ein Zufluchtsort fur geschutzte Arten. Der Artenschutz wird allerdings mit einer neuen Herausforderung konfrontiert: der langsamen Ruckkehr des Wolfs ins Mangfallgebirge. Wolfe konnen eine Bedrohung fur die Almwiesen sein, doch auch sie sind in Deutschland streng geschutzt. Die Dokumentation begleitet einen in Deutschland stark bedrohten Schmetterling, den Storchschnabel-Blauling, wahrend seines Jahrs auf den Almwiesen. Der Film prasentiert, wie raffiniert die √úberlebensstrategien dieses spezialisierten Tagfalters vom Ei bis zum fertigen Blauling sind. Der Falter reagiert sehr sensibel auf seine Umwelt. Er steht damit beispielhalt fur viele anspruchsvolle und in der Folge selten gewordene Tierarten.

<title>Paris, Hauptstadt der Bienen</title>
<desc>In Paris fallt es den fleiSSigen Insekten leicht, Nahrung zu finden, auch dank der uber das ganze Jahr verteilten Blutezeiten. Die abwechslungsreiche Stadtvegetation bietet den Bienen eine Nahrungsvielfalt, die es auf dem Land aufgrund von Monokulturen haufig nicht mehr gibt. Zudem wurde in Paris entschieden, den Gebrauch von Pestiziden ganz einzustellen. Selbst vom Aussterben bedroht, ist die Biene damit zum Symbol des Erhalts der Biodiversitat geworden. Eines der Habitate der Honigbienen von Paris existiert schon seit rund 400 Jahren: der Jardin des Plantes, ein botanischer Garten. Hier finden sich, etwas versteckt, Bienenstocke, die von der Gartnerin Vanessa Voskobo√Ønikoff umsorgt werden. Abseits der √ñffentlichkeit wahnt man sich weit drauSSen auf dem Land, und doch ist man mitten im Herzen von Paris. Ruhe ist fur die Tiere auch in der Stadt wichtig. Die Honigbiene ist ein sogenanntes staatenbildendes Insekt. Sie kann nur in der Gemeinschaft leben. In der Hochsaison zahlt ein Bienenstock etwa 50.000 Bienen und produziert im Schnitt 30 Kilogramm Honig. Um zu wissen, wann es Zeit ist zu ernten, uberprufen die Imker mit Hilfe eines Refraktometers den Feuchtigkeitsgehalt. Auch der Parc de la Villette beheimatet Bienenstocke in einem Schulbauernhof. Hier betreibt der junge Imker Pierre Merlet ein engagiertes Bienenprojekt. Er gewinnt Honig und klart nebenher regelmaSSig interessierte Gruppen uber das Wohl und die Probleme der Honigbienen auf.

Sachsens schillernder Herrscher August der Starke wollte aus seiner Residenz eine barocke Perle machen und so seine absolute Macht demonstrieren. Der Pomp von Versailles und die Alluren von Frankreichs Sonnenkonig waren das groSSe Idol dieser Epoche. Der Dresdner Zwinger mit seinen "tanzenden" Sandsteinfassaden und versteckten Wasserspielen ist das Herzstuck barocker Prachtentfaltung in dieser alten Fursten-Residenz: gebaut als steinerne Machtreprasentation Augusts, angelegt als Garten fur kostspielige Orangenbaume und genutzt als Festplatz fur eine Fursten-Hochzeit, die den Anspruch auf den Kaiserthron anmelden sollte. Der Zwinger lasst uns heute in eine Epoche blicken, in der Prunk und Verschwendung zur Reprasentationspflicht eines Fursten gehorten. August der Starke kann seinen Sohn mit einer osterreichischen Kaisertochter verheiraten. Ein unglaublicher Triumph. 1719 feiert der europaische Hochadel deshalb im Zwinger eines der glanzendsten Feste der Barockzeit - mit Reiterspielen, Kostumfest und riesigem Festmahl. Der Zwinger ist der Startschuss fur eine Stadt, die ein Gesamtkunstwerk werden sollte.

<sub-title>Das Gedachtnis der Pflanzen und Tiere</sub-title>
<desc>Eine neue HeiSSzeit wirft ihre Schatten voraus und verandert unsere √ñkosysteme tiefgreifend. Wie die Zukunft aussehen konnte, erforschen Wissenschaftler an Hitzeperioden der erdgeschichtlichen Vergangenheit. Im Bighorn Basin in Wyoming im Norden der USA ist eine erdgeschichtliche Epoche besonders interessant, denn vor 56 Millionen Jahren erwarmte sich die Erde - vermutlich aufgrund von Vulkanausbruchen - besonders schnell. Nicht so rasant wie heute, aber dennoch eignet sich die Phase des sogenannten Palaozan/Eozan-Temperaturmaximums (PETM) fur Vergleiche mit heutigen Entwicklungen. Fossilien verraten Erstaunliches uber die Tiere, aber auch wie Pflanzen damals reagiert haben. Die Forschenden rekonstruieren, dass sich Vegetationszonen auf der Erde um mehr als 1.000 Kilometer polwarts verschoben haben. Und sie erfahren Beunruhigendes uber die CO2-Speicherkapazitat der Pflanzen. In einem Permafrosttunnel nahe Fairbanks in Alaska reist ein Forschungsteam zuruck in die letzte Eiszeit. Die Untersuchung des Permafrostbodens zeigt, dass in ihm riesige Mengen abgestorbenes Pflanzenmaterial konserviert sind. Taut der Boden, verrottet das Material und der Kohlenstoff geht wieder in die Atmosphare zuruck, als Methan und Kohlendioxid. In Australien entwickelt ein Palaontologenteam gemeinsam mit Artenschutzern eine neue Wissenschaft. Sie wollen aus der Vergangenheit lernen, wie Arten heute und in Zukunft besser geschutzt werden konnen. Mit dieser Strategie wollen sie ein etwa mausgroSSes Beuteltier, das ausschlieSSlich in Australien vorkommt, vor dem Aussterben retten.</desc>

<sub-title>Das Gedachtnis der Meere und Ozeane</sub-title>
<desc>Eine neue HeiSSzeit wirft ihre Schatten voraus und verandert auch die Ozeane tiefgreifend. Wie ihre Zukunft aussehen konnte, erforschen Wissenschaftler an Hitzeperioden der Vergangenheit. An der Universitat Utrecht wird erforscht, was wahrend einer besonders schnellen Erwarmung vor 56 Millionen Jahren in den tropischen Meeren passierte: Sie ahnelten Whirlpools, waren bis zu 38 Grad warm, und nahezu alles Leben verschwand aus ihnen. In Frankreich spuren Palaontologen den Lebensbedingungen urzeitlicher Korallen nach. Sie entdecken: Die Organismen siedeln sich bei steigendenden Temperaturen in kuhleren Breiten an, wachsen dort aber langsamer. Hoffnung bieten auch Refugien wie der Golf von Akaba im Roten Meer. Durch einen erdgeschichtlichen Zufall leben Korallen dort in einem fur sie kuhlen Wasser - sind aber gleichzeitig sehr hitzetolerant. Doch nicht nur warme Meeresgebiete stehen unter Druck. An der Nordwestkuste der USA sorgt die Erderwarmung fur mehr Nordwind, der mehr kaltes, nahrstoffreiches Wasser aus der Tiefe aufsteigen lasst. Die Folge: In den oberen Wasserschichten explodiert das Leben. Doch am Meeresboden zersetzen Bakterien herabsinkende Biomasse und zehren den gesamten Sauerstoff auf. Todeszonen bilden sich. Durch den Meeresspiegelanstieg dringen die Ozeane immer weiter in unseren Lebensraum vor. Geologen der Columbia University in New York rekonstruieren daher aus antarktischen Sedimentkernen und fossilen Korallenriffen, dass der Meeresspiegel in der letzten Warmphase vor 125.000 Jahren bei einem Klima wie heute rund vier Meter angestiegen ist.</desc>

<sub-title>Finden wir den perfekten Geheimcode?</sub-title>
<desc>Dass unsere Daten verschlusselt sind, wenn wir E-Mails abrufen, uns bei unseren Bankkonten anmelden, Nachrichten auf Messenger-Diensten verschicken oder im Internet surfen, verdanken wir der Kryptographie. Im Hintergrund tobt dabei ein Zweikampf: Die Kryptographen entwickeln sichere Geheimcodes, wahrend die Codeknacker versuchen, diese Verschlusselung zu brechen. Es ist ein Katz-und-Maus-Spiel, das sich von der Antike, uber Julius Casar, die Konigshauser im 17. Jahrhundert bis in unsere moderne Welt durchzieht, erklart Cecile Pierrot (Inria Nancy). Je geschickter die Codeknacker agieren, desto ausgefeilter mussen die Verschlusselungsverfahren werden. Unsere Daten heute sind dadurch gesichert, dass niemand die Verfahren knacken kann, die sie schutzen. Zumindest noch nicht. Denn das Spiel konnte eine neue Wendung bekommen: Derzeit werden Quantencomputer entwickelt, die so ganz anders ticken als bisherige Rechner. Sollten sie eines Tages gut funktionieren, konnten sie unsere jetzige Verschlusselung im Handumdrehen brechen - ein Sicherheitsrisiko fur uns personlich und die globale Gesellschaft. "Ohne Kryptographie ware unsere heutige Welt nicht vorstellbar", sagt Peter Schwabe vom Max-Planck-Institut fur Sicherheit und Privatsphare. Zusammen mit dem Mathematiker Eike Kiltz (Ruhr-Universitat Bochum) entwickelt er neue Kryptographie-Verfahren. Doch ist es moglich einen Geheimcode zu finden, der sowohl den Angriffen heutiger Computer als auch denen der Quantencomputer von morgen standhalten kann?</desc>

<title>Courage</title>
<desc>Im Zuge der Prasidentschaftswahlen in WeiSSrussland im Sommer 2020 geraten zwei Schauspieler und eine Schauspielerin des Belarus Free Theatre aus Minsk in den Sog der Massenproteste, der sie auf die StraSSe zieht, um lautstark fur freie MeinungsauSSerung und den langersehnten Machtwechsel zu demonstrieren. Doch ihr friedlicher Protest wird vom Sicherheitsapparat des Regimes brutal niedergeschlagen. Mitglieder der Theatergruppe und viele andere Menschen werden verhaftet. Das Land steht am Rande eines Burgerkriegs. Der Dokumentarfilm "Courage" begleitet in eindringlichen und zum Teil erschutternden Bildern den mutigen und friedlichen Widerstand von Maryna, Pavel und Denis vor und wahrend der Proteste. Der Film wirft einen sehr personlichen Blick auf die Ereignisse, gibt hautnah und packend Einblick in das Leben der Menschen im heutigen Belarus, die fur ihre Freiheit und das Recht auf Demokratie kampfen. Mittlerweile ist kein Ensemble-Mitglied mehr in Belarus, alle sind geflohen. Regisseur Aliaksei Palyyan wurde in Belarus geboren und lebt seit 2012 in Deutschland.

<title>Spieler seines Lebens - F.M. Dostojewski</title>
<desc>Alles oder Nichts! Die Kugel rollt. Die Nerven liegen blank. Denn das gesamte Schicksal wird sich in dieser einzigen, alles verheiSSenden Sekunde entscheiden. Gluck oder Vernichtung! Wie seine Hauptfigur im Roman "Der Spieler" fordert auch der russische Schriftsteller Dostojewski sein Schicksal immer wieder heraus. Beim Roulette, wie auch im Leben. Bei der Niederschrift des Romans "Der Spieler" setzt er seine Existenz aufs Spiel. Liefert er nicht fristgerecht, wird er die Rechte an seinem gesamten Werk verlieren. Am Ende bleiben Dostojewski gerade einmal 26 Tage, um den Roman zu schreiben. Schafft er es nicht, ist er ein Schriftsteller ohne Werk.Anlasslich des 200. Geburtstages des russischen Dichters erzahlt ARTE die bewegende Entstehungsgeschichte dieses stark autobiografisch gefarbten Romans als einen existentiellen Wettlauf gegen die Zeit. Der Film montiert Spielfilmszenen und dokumentarische Aufnahmen von Originalschauplatzen in Russland und Deutschland mit den Aussagen namhafter Experten und zeigt die Stationen eines so kompromisslosen wie dramatischen Lebensweges, dessen zentraler Wendepunkt direkt mit der Niederschrift des Spieler-Romans verbunden ist: als Dostojewski glaubt, seine gesamte Zukunft verspielt zu haben, tritt der Mensch in sein Leben, der bis zu seinem Ende der wichtigste fur ihn sein wird: die zwanzig Jahre jungere Anna Snitkina. Als Stenotypistin hilft sie Dostojewski beim Schreiben des Romans, als Ehefrau spielt sie das Spiel seines Lebens mit. Anna begleitet Dostojewski an die Spieltische nach Deutschland, um am Ende vollig neue Spielregeln zu setzen.</desc>

<title>Planet Earth III</title>
<sub-title>Human</sub-title>
<desc>The human world, from our cities to our fields, has spread to every corner of the globe. Wildlife must now adapt to a vastly altered landscape... and contend directly with us. Some animals are meeting this challenge head-on and thriving. In Bali, long-tailed macaques have learned to steal tourists most precious items and then use them to barter with temple staff for their favourite food. The older males simply wont give you back your phone unless they get what theyre after. For many animals living alongside us, it pays to keep a low profile. Tawny frogmouths are masters of camouflage, and in Melbourne, Australia, they are preyed upon by pet cats. Nevertheless, frogmouths are doing well here because the streetlights help them find their prey, and in many parts of the city they are now found in a higher density than in the surrounding countryside. Some animals are so bold, they dont even try to hide. Rhinos walk through the streets of Sauraha, Nepal, simply to reach food on the other side of town. In Lake Tahoe, USA, black bears head right to the centre of town in search of food. Ahead of hibernation, it is crucial to put on as much weight as possible. The rich food these city bears can find in the dumpsters means that they are up to 50 per cent heavier than their country cousins. Some enterprising individuals have gone a step further. They have worked out that a simple push on a door can lead them into a room stacked high with food. Quite a surprise for someone popping into the shop to buy a snack. For wildlife, part of the challenge is to keep up with us. Pavement ants are the most common ant in New York City, outnumbering New Yorkers by 1,000 to 1. The secret to their success is their digestive system, which has been able to keep pace with the constantly changing human diet. Ninety per cent of what they eat now comes from human food. On Broadway Avenue alone, they eat the equivalent of 60,000 hotdogs a year. Life is not so straightforward for animals that are feared or persecuted by humans. Snakebites cause an estimated 60,000 human deaths every year in India alone, but in one Indian village, venomous cobras are seen hunting inside peoples houses. Remarkably, scientists believe that this co-existence has led to a change in the snakes behaviour. They move more slowly and are less likely to strike when disturbed. However, when animals come into the human world to compete for resources, it often leads to conflict. In Kenya, once the sun has set, African elephant bulls venture to fields of tomatoes to gorge. Its a dangerous job for the farmers trying to repel the largest land animals on the planet. Wildlife that eat the same food as humans doesnt always result in competition. Humpback whales off the coast of Vancouver Island inhabit waters that have been overfished. You would think that their presence would reduce fish stocks even further, but astonishingly the opposite is thought to be happening. It is all because of the iron in the whales poo! It fertilises the ocean here and feeds the phytoplankton, which is the basis of the food chain. The fish feed on the growing phytoplankton population and, even though the whales are feasting on them, their numbers are predicted to increase. Not only do the whales, and their poo, play an important role in restoring the ecosystem, but they also combat climate change. The phytoplankton photosynthesise, taking carbon out of the atmosphere, just like trees do. Thanks to whale poo, their numbers grow to such an extent that each great whale has the same impact as planting 30,000 trees! Although some species are managing to thrive in the human world, in many parts our actions are putting unprecedented pressure on wildlife. Our fates, however, are closely intertwined. If the natural world is not protected, it could be devastating for all of us. The major challenge will be reimagining the way we live on this planet to find ways to protect all life on earth.</desc>

<desc>1930. aastal avastatud Pluutot Paikesesusteemi serval peeti aastakumneid tahtsusetuks jaakeraks, kuid kosmosesondi New Horizons uued avastused on jahmatanud ka teaduskogukonda. Pildid annavad tunnistust keerulisest aktiivsest maailmast jaast sepitsetud magede, naivalt liikuvate lammastikuliustike ja hiljuti pursanud vulkaanidega. See aga tahendab, et seal v√µib olla elu.</desc>

<sub-title>Bicycles</sub-title>
<desc>Gregg Wallace explores the largest bicycle factory in Britain which produces 150 folding bicycles every 24 hours and joins a multi-stage manual production line to make his very own bike. Hell learn how to put together 1200 individual parts and attempt to braze a bike frame together using extreme heat of a thousand degrees, a skill that takes years to master. Hell also visit a leather saddle maker in Birmingham thats been making saddles for 150 years and discover how they use cowhide from UK and Ireland cows because the cold weather means they have thicker skins. Meanwhile Cherry Healey gets some tips from Cycling Team GB to help us all improve our pedal power, including how lowering your body position can make a 10% improvement to speed and efficiency. She also learns how to paint a bike frame fit for the British weather using an electro-static charge and a 180 degree hot oven; and investigates why cyclists and trucks are such a deadly combination: in London alone there have been 66 fatalities since 2011 and half of them were collisions with a truck. And historian Ruth Goodman reveals that folding bikes date back to the 1870s, and how 70,000 folding "parabikes" were manufactured during World War II, some of which played a role in the D-Day landings. Shell also find out how the invention of the safety bicycle in the late 1880s was used by Suffragettes to ride to rallies and spread the word in their fight for equality.</desc>

<sub-title>Fresh Water</sub-title>
<desc>Fresh water is the lifeblood of planet Earth and the stage for extraordinary animal dramas. In the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, a little-known spectacle unfolds above a very special pond. Up to ten thousand gliding tree frogs - the worlds largest known gathering of its kind - descend from the canopy for the most important breeding event of the year. It will only last a day, and with males outnumbering females nine to one, competition is fierce. This is a party you dont want to be late for. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, as the dry season reaches its peak, the last remaining waterhole for miles around becomes a magnet for a different animal: mugger crocodiles. Giants up to five metres long lurk beneath the surface, waiting patiently for thirsty chital deer to approach the waterhole for a drink. But catching their prey is no easy feat and requires them to do something extraordinary. Documented nowhere else, these crafty crocodiles have learned how to exploit their preys need for fresh water - by creating traps. Nestled amongst flowering water lilies, newly hatched "lily-trotter" chicks learn a vital lesson - how to walk on water. Their oversized feet - almost double the length of their body - make for a wobbly start, but their dedicated father will do whatever it takes to keep them safe during the most vulnerable stage of their life. One of the biggest challenges of living in a freshwater world is its dynamic nature. It can appear, vanish or transform rapidly. Survival in these dynamic environments hinges on adaptation. In the Okavango Delta, the arrival of the great annual flood poses a significant challenge for a pack of five African wild dogs. On dry land, they are one of the continents most successful hunters, but as their hunting grounds turn to swamp, they must find an innovative way to master this water world. Meanwhile, millions of goby fish on the remote volcanic island of Bioko prepare for a perilous journey. After months feeding out at sea, they return to fresh water to breed. The safest place to lay their eggs is where ocean predators cant follow - at the very top of a 30m waterfall. Surely an impossible journey for a fish only an inch long, and one that will require a bizarre physical transformation. In a few rare places, like Lake Malawi, fresh water has remained a consistent presence for millions of years, resulting in a dazzling diversity of life. Here, over a thousand unique fish species thrive - more than any other lake on earth, but competition in these crowded waters is intense. To survive here takes ingenuity. Meet Nimbochromis livingstonii - a master of deception that tricks other fish into thinking its dead. Fresh water is vital to life, yet it is a finite resource. Of all the water on earth, only 2.5 per cent is fresh and most of that is locked up as ice or hidden deep below ground. In fact, less than one per cent of fresh water is accessible. Humans rely on fresh water for drinking, agriculture, irrigation, industry and power. Throughout history, we have devised extraordinary means to ensure it is always available for every demand, fostering the dangerous illusion that it is infinitely abundant. Yet today, two-thirds of our worlds great rivers no longer reach the sea, and in the last 50 years, freshwater species have seen an 83 per cent decline globally - a faster decline than that of species in any other habitat. One animal suffering on the front line is the Indus river dolphin in Pakistan. This species is the most endangered freshwater dolphin globally, with only around two thousand individuals remaining. Every year, these dolphins get trapped in the network of irrigation canals which form part of the vast Indus Basin irrigation system - the largest such system on earth. These canals divert water from the Indus River to irrigate crops. As water levels drop due to agricultural demands, the dolphins become stranded in ever-shrinking pools, often hundreds of kilometres away from the main river. Their only hope for survival depends on the efforts of a dedicated rescue team, working to return them back to the river before its too late.</desc>

<title>L√µuna-Korea koos Alexander Armstrongiga</title>
<desc>On the last leg of his South Korean adventure, Alexander Armstrong heads to the bustling port of Busan, where South Koreas biggest fish market is to be found. Alexander gets to try some of the weirdest seafood youve ever seen, fresh from the sea, including a couple of sea creatures that are so fresh theyre still moving as he bites into them. The area around Busan is home to a delicious, nutritious and slightly boozy rice wine drink called makgeolli and, after the full-on intensity of modern Seoul, Alexander is delighted to meet a famous brewer who uses an ancient recipe for makgeolli, the basis of which are strange cakes of wheat made by hand or, more precisely, by foot. Hopping 180 miles across the Korea Strait from Busan, Alexander finds himself on South Koreas largest island Jeju, where Alexander meets a famous dyer of cloth who uses only the juice of the persimmon fruit and sunlight to create gorgeous textiles. Jeju is a place where ancient beliefs are still practised by a ritual priest, or shaman, to help people with physical and mental problems. Its a pretty gruelling business being treated by a shaman, but our adventurer has been suffering from insomnia and nows the time to see if the spirit world can help. After an exhilarating climb up the extinct volcano known as Sunrise Peak, the intrepid Mr Armstrong has an appointment to meet the endangered but not at all cuddly Jeju wild dog. By this point, Alexander is so hungry he could eat a horse. So he does, in Jejus premier horsemeat restaurant. Most of it is raw, but hes up to the job, before he finds out what has happened to the puppies of the Jeju wild dogs that would have happily eaten him earlier on.</desc>

Over the course of three weeks, Steve Backshall discovers why the Bahamas provide such sanctuary for sharks, looking at the protection offered to them, peoples changing attitudes and the key role science plays in their conservation.

<sub-title>Lincolnshire</sub-title>
<desc>Ben heads to northern England on a journey through a different kind of wild living: vanlife. He stays with host Paul to discover why he traded living in a house for life on the road. He learns how Paul joined a community of full-time nomads, surviving on the road and off the grid, right here in the UK, as well as discovering the challenges that lie ahead for this growing movement. Ben meets Paul in Lincolnshire onboard his 30-year-old converted military truck, Roxy. Together they travel to the stunning coastline to stay overnight on a beach. Ben is familiar with van-lifers in the US but is intrigued to find out how the lifestyle is possible in the UK with its strict wild camping laws. Together they go on a road-trip, share in an unusual hobby and meet Pauls nomadic community.</desc>

<title>L√µuna-Korea koos Alexander Armstrongiga</title>
<desc>On the last leg of his South Korean adventure, Alexander Armstrong heads to the bustling port of Busan, where South Koreas biggest fish market is to be found. Alexander gets to try some of the weirdest seafood youve ever seen, fresh from the sea, including a couple of sea creatures that are so fresh theyre still moving as he bites into them. The area around Busan is home to a delicious, nutritious and slightly boozy rice wine drink called makgeolli and, after the full-on intensity of modern Seoul, Alexander is delighted to meet a famous brewer who uses an ancient recipe for makgeolli, the basis of which are strange cakes of wheat made by hand or, more precisely, by foot. Hopping 180 miles across the Korea Strait from Busan, Alexander finds himself on South Koreas largest island Jeju, where Alexander meets a famous dyer of cloth who uses only the juice of the persimmon fruit and sunlight to create gorgeous textiles. Jeju is a place where ancient beliefs are still practised by a ritual priest, or shaman, to help people with physical and mental problems. Its a pretty gruelling business being treated by a shaman, but our adventurer has been suffering from insomnia and nows the time to see if the spirit world can help. After an exhilarating climb up the extinct volcano known as Sunrise Peak, the intrepid Mr Armstrong has an appointment to meet the endangered but not at all cuddly Jeju wild dog. By this point, Alexander is so hungry he could eat a horse. So he does, in Jejus premier horsemeat restaurant. Most of it is raw, but hes up to the job, before he finds out what has happened to the puppies of the Jeju wild dogs that would have happily eaten him earlier on.</desc>

Tony travels the length of the Nile, from Cairo to Aswan, to investigate tombs of all shapes and sizes, meeting the archaeologists making an extraordinary new wave of discoveries.

<desc>Israeli violinist Itzhak Perlman and the Berlin Philharmonic perform Johannes Brahms Violin Concerto (1833-1897) under the direction of Daniel Barenboim. After Beethovens Violin Concerto, Brahms piece is probably the most famous German Violin Concerto ever written. These two works have much in common, especially the tone in D major in which they were composed. Highly technical, Brahms Violin Concerto is reserved for virtuosos because of the marked presence of arpeggios, rapid passages of scales and rhythmic variations. Perlman and the Berlin Philharmonic are brilliantly meeting the challenge of this technically and intellectually demanding work.</desc>

The invention of the film camera and television has allowed audiences to see not only beautiful dancing and wonderful choreography, but it also brought the dancers facial expressions and stage presence to the screen. These technical developments allowed this essentially ephemeral art form to be preserved. Dance on screen, about both classical ballet and modern dance, features interviews with recognized choreographers and directors.

<title>Bach - The Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1 No.1 to 12</title>
<desc>In 1722, when Johann Sebastian Bach lived in Kothen, Germany, he published a book of preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys. This collection became known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book One, BWV 846-869. About two decades later, Bach compiled a second book in Leipzig, which became known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book Two, BWV 870-893. Bach intended these pieces for the clavier, which includes the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ. Despite this unclarity, these pieces are regarded as some of the most important works in the history of Western classical music.

<desc>Renowned French string quartet Quatuor √âb√®ne marked the 250th birth anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) with a remarkable project: recording all of the great composers sixteen string quartets. For five years, violinists Pierre Colombet and Gabriel Le Magadure, violist Marie Chilemme, and cellist Rapha√´l Merlin immersed themselves in Beethovens 650 pages of sheet music. Their efforts culminated in the performance of the composers complete repertoire for string quartet, which covers three decades of Beethovens musical creativity, during six impressive concerts at Philharmonie de Paris in the autumn of 2020. Quatuor √âb√®ne explored every facet of Beethovens string quartet repertoire: from the youthful Opus 18 string quartets to the Razumovsky, Harp, and Serioso quartets (Opus 59, 74, and 95) from his middle period, and finally, the depth of his late quartets (Opus 127 to 135). This program features Quatuor √âb√®ne performing Beethovens String Quartet No. 2 in G major, Op. 18, No. 2; String Quartet No. 16 in F major, Op. 135; and String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 131.

The increasing population is taking over vast swathes of natural land and in turn, adding to the demand for natural resources. This series explores the different concepts being used to help sustain our future, such as alternative resources, biodiversity conservation and the future of travel.</desc>

<desc>To say expert British mechanic Ant Anstead is a lover of cars would be an understatement. The term petrol head does not quite cover the passion he exudes for motor vehicles. One of the vehicles that Ant has a particular obsession with is the 1930s Alfa Romeo 158 Grand Prix race car, one of the greatest racers ever made, which he is honouring in this documentary series by building his own from scratch. We follow Ant and his Alfa on their journey from workshop to race circuit, as he overcomes challenges, setbacks and deadlines to get this commemorative racer ready in time.</desc>

<desc>Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir follows the adventures of two teens living in Paris- Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste. Marinette has a crush on Adrien, but it is not going to be a classic love story of the two. In order to protect Paris from evil Marinette turns into Ladybug and Adrien into Cat Noir. Their main enemy is Hawk Moth, who by using black butterflies infused with negative energy, wants to transform Paris citizens into super villains. It is particularly remarkable that Marinette does not know that couragious Cat Noir is her crush Adrien, which in turn does not suspect Marinette of being brave Ladybug.</desc>

<sub-title>Tim Kliphuis and the NCO: The Changing Seasons</sub-title>
<desc>The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra commissioned violinist Tim Kliphuis, internationally known for his genre-crossing approach to music, to write a new version of Antonio Vivaldis Four Seasons. Kliphuis choose to take improvisation as his starting point; at the same time, he intended to leave the best-known Vivaldi themes and chords in, as they give the piece its wonderful energy. The result is a fresh and exciting interpretation that never loses sight of the original. Each season has a different character: the freshness of spring is reflected by the use of Irish and Norwegian traditional music; the summer heat can be heard in the American jazz and funk rhythms; the autumn includes a galloping safari hunt in South-Africa and the ice-cold winter warms up with the energy of Russian gypsy music. For each movement, Kliphuis has a metropole in mind which he visited on his previous concert tours. Youre about to witness a truly genre-crossing spectacle!</desc>

<sub-title>Chamber Music: Sissoko and Segal</sub-title>
<desc>Hailing from a long tradition of Malian kora players, Ballake Sissoko has worked with renowned musicians such as Toumani Diabate and Taj Mahal. He met the French born Vincent Segal by chance, and the two began jamming together, uncertain of what kind of music might result. As a former member of the French National Orchestra, Segals Western classical training does not prevent him from exploring a wide variety of extended techniques, rendering his cello a flexible partner to Sissokos kora. A childhood spent in the Pigalle district of Paris surrounded by immigrant communities exposed Segal to African music from an early age. As such, he possesses a natural sensitivity to Sissokos West-African style. The concert shows a brilliant interplay between the two musicians and combines the several worlds of jazz, Malian and classical music.</desc>

Miles Davis was a genius. Coltrane stood above - he was a visionary, a saint-like figure. By the standards of most jazz musicians, his life was uneventful. Sure, he had a heroin habit for a while, and Miles Davis punched him, but once hed experienced the "spiritual awakening" described in the liner notes of his 1965 album A Love Supreme, he dedicated himself to his music with extreme single-mindedness.

<sub-title>Bakolo Music International</sub-title>
<desc>Since 1994, World Music Expo (WOMEX) has been attracting musicians, agents, a great number of press agencies, as well as media companies from all over the world. Its main exposition event has been held in various locations throughout Europe, including Berlin, Brussels, Marseille, Stockholm, Seville, Cardiff, and Budapest. In 2018, WOMEX was held in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. One of its showcase participants, Bakolo Music International, represents the pioneers of the golden age of Congolese rumba. The singer, guitarist and grand survivor Nzofu Moko Buele, known to all as Bikunda, is carrying on a torch first lit in 1948 by "Papa" Wend Kolosoy, the "father of Congolese Rumba" and composer of the first Rumba hit song, Marie-Louise.</desc>

<desc>Annual trade fair, exhibition, and festival jazzahead! is one of the international jazz communitys most important events. Hosted in Bremen, Germany, jazzahead! brings together musicians, bookers, agents, organizers, jazz experts, and music enthusiasts at the worlds largest jazz event. In 2023, jazzahead! paid special attention to Germanys jazz scene and invited thirty jazz acts from all over the world to perform over the course of three days. Among the artists presenting themselves at jazzahead! 2023 is Belgian-Japanese piano wizard Alex Koo. In his brand new Etudes for Piano, composed for and commissioned by BOZAR Brussels, he shows how his passion for jazz and classical music merge perfectly, like a marriage between Debussy, Chopin, Reich, and Rachmaninov on the one hand, and Keith Jarrett, Craig Taborn, Brian Eno, and Philip Glass on the other.</desc>

<title>Ryan Porter and The West Coast Get Down - BIRD</title>
<desc>Los Angeles-born saxophonist Kamasi Washington and trombonist Ryan Porter co-founded West Coast Get Down - a musical collective fusing jazz and funk with hip-hop. It is partly because of this collective that jazz saw a resurgence in Los Angeles, subtly eclipsing the long-established jazz mecca of the world, New York City. The two musicians join forces and take the vibes of Los Angeles to jazz club BIRD in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</desc>

<title>Anita Oday Live in Sweden 1963</title>
<desc>Anita ODay boasts two wonderful concerts from 1963 and 1970 that present the "jazz singer supreme" in impeccable form. ODays horn-based approach to singing is in full effect throughout both shows including stand-out renditions in each show of audience favorites "Tea For Two" and "Sweet Georgia Brown" (both reprised from her triumphant appearance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.) This show is a fitting testimony to one of jazz musics true originals and shows unequivocally why she is ranked in the top tier of vocalists along with Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Billie Holiday.</desc>

<desc>Naitleja Laine Magi on s√µna otseses m√µttes tantsinud labi elu. Balleti√µpingud, v√µistlustants ja varietee - just siis, kui see k√µik oli k√µige rohkem moes ning k√µige paremini sobis. Lavakunstikateeder, Parnu Teater Endla ja Draamateater... Nuud ka oma tantsukool. K√µik see on tulnud √µblukese Kehra tudruku ellu just siis, kui selleks on k√µige √µigem hetk olnud. Toimekas ja r√µ√µmus Laine veedab suure osa oma elust maanteel - Parnu ja Tallinna vahel, usub haakn√µelte kaitsej√µusse ning et k√µige parem osa elust on alles ees. Saates randab ta mooda sisses√µidetud teed Kehrast Tallinna ja Tallinnast Parnusse ning raagib elust ning surmast, teatrist ja tantsust, meenutab ning unistab.

<desc>Annika Koppeli dokumentaalfilmis on fookuses keeleteadlase, esseisti, √µppej√µu ning Eesti taasiseseisvumise ajal poliitikas olulist rolli manginud Mati Hindi elu ja loometee. Poordelistel uheksakumnendatel oli aarmiselt oluline, et eesti keelest saaks riigikeel ja selleks tuli vastu v√µtta keeleseadus. Mati Hint oli keeleseaduse ideoloog ja tanu tema julgusele nurjusid katsed seda viimasel hetkel muuta. Nii t√µigi tema massumeelsus kasu Eesti riigile. Film uurib, missugune roll oli L√µuna-Eesti viljakatel maastikel ja karmil ajalool kompromissitu loomuse ning massaja vaimuisiksuse kujunemisel. Mati Hint suri 5. detsembril 2019. aastal, just samal paeval l√µppes ka Eesti keele aasta. Kas pole mitte tahenduslik? Filmis raagivad Mati Hindist tema kolleegid ulikoolidest, uli√µpilased, keeleteadlased ja lahedased. Tema elutoo ja isiksus avanevad uutest aspektidest. Ka Mati ise on veel kohal oma veidi toriseval, ent kindlal ja hoolival moel. Autor ja re≈æissoor Annika Koppel, produtsent Anneli Ahven. Tana on emakeelepaev.</desc>

Piiri kosmopoliitsusest annab aga pikemalt tunnistust 84-aastane kunagine Suuria s√µjap√µgenik Maynard Haddad, kes on 60 aastat El Pasos legendaarset autopesulat ja kohvikut pidanud - kummaski neist ettev√µtmistest ei ole selle aja jooksul remonti tehtud. Tema toolised on eranditult Mehhiko immigrandid, varjamatult aga kuulub Maynardi poliitiline poolehoid president Trumpile.

Lugu filmistuudiost Eesti Reklaamfilm, uhe mehe peas sundinud ettev√µttest, mis ainsana N√µukogude Liidus tootis reklaame. Peedu Ojamaa juhtimisel valmistasid sajad andekad nupumehed ja filmiloojad tuhandeid reklaamfilme, mis uldise kaubapuuduse ning sotsialistliku kasumajanduse tingimustes olid m√µnikord sunnitud reklaamima ka olematuid asju. Need klipid vallutasid miljoneid sudameid... Autorid Kiur Aarma, Hardi Volmer, teksti loeb T√µnu Aav.</desc>

<desc>Len√ßois Maranhensese k√µrb on uks planeedi ebatavalisemaid paiku. Siin ei ole tuupilist liivamaastikku, kopterist on naha, et luited vahelduvad suure hulga jarvedega. Pool aastat kestval vihmahooajal kogunev vesi ei j√µua kuiva hooaja jooksul ara aurata. K√µrbe, kus on jarved ja mets, ei leidu kusagil mujal. Dmitri kulastab kahte k√µrbekula - uhte l√µunaosas, kuhu paaseb ATV-ga, ja teist kaitsealal, kuhu j√µudmiseks tuleb labida kaheksatunnine jalgsimatk. Millised on k√µrbes elamise plussid ja miinused?</desc>

<desc>Dmitri kulastab Ararase kula, mille elanikud tulevad majast valja alles √µhtul, sest paikesekiired tekitavad nende nahale haavandeid. Kaua aega usuti, et tegu on jumala karistusega ja haiged inimesed t√µrjuti uhiskonnast valja. Kuid perekond, kelle k√µik liikmsed on kuue varba ja s√µrmega, peab seda jumala kingituseks, et paremini hakkama saama.</desc>

<desc>√úksk√µik kui erinevad brasiillased ka poleks, on neil k√µigil uks uhine joon - vankumatu usk n√µidusesse ja vaimudesse. Rio de Janeiro turg kubiseb maagiliste rituaalide atribuutidest.

Grant, Dolly Wells Tempokas ja m√µnusa huumoriga vurtsitatud kirjanduslik maiuspala p√µhineb t√µsielu sundmustel, mis viivad meid New Yorki aastal 1991. Autor Lee Israel toob leiva lauale kuulsate ja vahem kuulsate, kuid markimisvaarsete isikute biograafiate kirjutamisega. Paraku ei paku tema teemavalikud enam kirjastustele huvi ning tal on raskusi elatise teenimisega. Kuid napsulembese naise viskipudelid ootavad taitmist, uur maksmist ja kassi loomakliiniku arved tasumist. Israel hakkab toekama sissetuleku nimel oma kirjutamisannet kasutama kuulsate autorite isiklike kirjade v√µltsimiseks. Alustades vaiksematest ja suututest kirjakestest j√µuab ta peagi suuremate paladeni, mis aratavad omas valdkonnas jarjest suuremat tahelepanu ning palvivad markimisvaarseid summasid.

We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons.

<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons.

<desc>Join our hosts, Mikey Kay and Garth Baldwin, as they investigate whether the famed and mysterious Knights Templar were really disbanded and destroyed in 1307 or if they survived, taking the Holy Grail with them. The historical detectives journey through the middle-east in an attempt to uncover new evidence of the true fate of this secretive organization. Starting off in the holy city of Jerusalem, the team explore archaic tunnels and a safe house that could have been used to smuggle religious relics to safety. Their exploratory travels then take them to the ancient city of Acre and on to Cypress to search for clues about a covert Templar mission. Secret Templar codes lead the unit to a monastery in Spain which might be able to prove that the knights survived the fateful arrests of Friday the 13th, 1307.</desc>

Unlike most crime shows which focus on the motives or backstory of the killers, this show exposes the real, deadly impact on those who suffer at the hands of the perpetrator. The stories of everyday people who get caught up in these heinous crimes often go unheard and it is equally important that these individuals get to tell their stories as it is for us to hear them. Sunny also interviews the detectives, prosecutors, coroners, and others involved to piece together the truth of each case.

<title>Truth About Murder With Sunny Hostin</title>
<sub-title>T√°mad√°s a parkban</sub-title>
<desc>Host, and former federal prosecutor, Sunny Hostin (from The View) takes us on an investigative journey to uncover the true stories of crime victims and their loved ones. Unlike most crime shows which focus on the motives or backstory of the killers, this show exposes the real, deadly impact on those who suffer at the hands of the perpetrator. The stories of everyday people who get caught up in these heinous crimes often go unheard and it is equally important that these individuals get to tell their stories as it is for us to hear them. Sunny also interviews the detectives, prosecutors, coroners, and others involved to piece together the truth of each case. With an intention to be socially inclusive, the show highlights stories concerning people of color, women and the LGBTQ community.</desc>

<title>Naabriplika</title>
<desc>Vaba naine vabal maal v√µib olla just tapselt nii kole, kui ta ise tahab. Seda teab vallavanema naine paris tapselt ja edasine on juba vallavanema probleem. Krista eneseteadvuse t√µus suunab ta niimoodi jalle vallavalitsusse ruppe toole. Kirik√µpetajal on mure surijatega. Viimasel ajal kipuvad vallakodanikud lusikat nurka viskama valla k√µige kaugemates nurkades. Sageli ei j√µua Viktor enam √µigeks ajaks viimast v√µidmist tegema ja n√µnda sunnib tema peas plaan kolida v√µimalikud surijad k√µik vallakeskusse kokku. Vallavanem aga tema entusiasmi ei jaga ja nii puhkeb lahing surijate parast. Napsitrallid aga tulevad m√µttele luua oma ettev√µte. Kuid nagu selgub, ei piisagi alati vaid arvete √µigeaegsest esitamisest. M√µnikord tuleb tasu saamiseks ka reaalselt tood teha. Ja selle taha bussijaama asukate ari takerdubki.</desc>

<title>Suvitajad</title>
<desc>"Suvitajad" on ehedat kirge ja nakatavat nalja tais suvine komoodia, mis p√µhineb Juhan Smuuli samanimelisel jutustusel. Film valmis armastatud kirjaniku sajandaks sunniaastapaevaks ning on uhtlasi ka austusavaldus kunagisele kultuskomoodiale "Siin me oleme", mis vandati sama algmaterjali p√µhjal. Kalur √Ñrni on otsustanud nigela kalasaagi t√µttu jaaniajaks suvitajad v√µtta. Plaan pole ju paha, kuid tema kaunisse Muhumaa tallu saabuvad ulimalt tulikad kulalised: proua Sohvia, tema abikaasa Johan, nende poeg Juunior ja Sohvia kaunitarist √µde Erna koos oma arimehest kavaleri Ivoga. Juba esimesel pilgul on selge, et √Ñrnil ja tema naisel Lainel laheb suvitajatega vaga keeruliseks. Pealinnast tulnud suvitajad pakatavad tahtsusest ja n√µuavad erikohtlemist, samas on nende klantsi pealispinna all piinlikke saladusi, mis tuli kaigus avanema hakkavad. Linnarahva jagelustesse t√µmmatud maarahvas avastab nuud ka oma elus ullatavaid kitsaskohti. Naljakate segaduste ja intriigide saatel minnakse vastu jaanioole ning koos v√µimsa l√µkkega ...</desc>

She lives among humans and understands that animals are free, rather than slaves to the human race. A fantastic and entertaining bestiary appears on stage. The childrens performance is superb. Who else could convey such freshness, such savagery and such an imaginary world? We are offered a glimpse of an enchanted and fantastical world where love and freedom reign supreme. This light-spirited, na√Øve and melancholy fable introduces us to the great theatre of life. With ineffable poetry, Jan√°cek listens to and recreates the eternal Song of the Earth. .</desc>

<title>McCoy Tyner Trio live at Estival Lugano</title>
<desc>Since 1977, Estival is a summer jazz festival in Switzerland, Lugano. Estival offers a thrilling and particularly surprising line-up that explores the rich world of contemporary music whilst promoting the understanding of different cultures, tolerance, and co-existence. McCoy Tyners first main exposure came with Benny Golson, being the first pianist in Golsons and Art Farmers Jazztet. Hes also known for his work with the John Coltrane Quartet. Tyners style is easily comparable to Coltranes maximalist style of saxophone. Though a member of Coltranes group, he was never overshadowed by the saxophonist, but complemented and even inspired Coltranes open-minded approach. McCoy Tyner is considered one of the most influential jazz pianists of the 20th century, an honour he earned both with Coltrane and in his years of performing following Coltranes death.</desc>

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Under the Big Top</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<sub-title>Jeremy and Alex</sub-title>
<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<desc>US Airi lend 1493 (Boeing 737-300) ja Skywesti lend 5569 (Fairchild Metroliner), 1. veebruar 1991. Los Angelese rahvusvahelises lennujaamas kaib pidev sagimine, US Airi lend 1493 on kohe saabumas. Piloodid panevad lennuki 737 maandumiseks valmis, kuid hoolimata nende pidevatest k√µnedest juhiste saamiseks, ei vasta keegi. Loetud hetked enne maandumist antakse viimaks luba, kuid m√µni sekund enne maale j√µudmist puhkeb lennumasin leekidesse ja s√µidab sisse mahajaetud hoonesse. Paastetootajad kiirustavad appi, kuid samal ajal kui ellujaanud purgatooriumist valja tulevad, teevad paastjad hirmsa avastuse... Kas uurijad suudavad tuvastada, mis laks valesti?</desc>

<desc>Nelikummend aastat tagasi, 18. mail 1980, purskus Saint Helensi vulkaan. See oli USA ajaloo k√µige ohvriterohkem ja havitavam vulkaaanipurse. Pealtnagijate utlused ja haruldased pildid kirjeldavad maailmal√µpule sarnanevaid sundmusi; alates vulkaanipurske esimestest hetkedest kuni 19 kilomeetri k√µrguse tuhasaju ja maest alla kihutava surmava mudavooluni.</desc>

<desc>WASHINGTON, D.C. 1952: Radar am Luftwaffenstutzpunkt Andrews und am Washington National Airport erfasste UFOs und zwei F-94-Jets der US-Luftwaffe rasten uber Washington auf der Suche nach fliegenden Untertassen.

In ganz Amerika verdrangte die Geschichte von Jets, die UFOs uber dem WeiSSen Haus jagten, den Koreakrieg und den Prasidentschaftswahlkampf von den Titelseiten der Zeitungen. Als sich Geruchte verbreiteten, wollte Prasident Truman wissen, was uber seinem Haus flog. Bald bekampfte die Bundesregierung die UFOs mit den machtigsten Waffen im Washingtoner Arsenal - Burokratie und Verschleierung.</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia. Tutti elementi che ritroveremo nelloriginalissimo studio di "√à sempre mezzogiorno!", ispirato al mondo delle fiabe e immerso simbolicamente nel bosco della Val Borbera. Ad affiancare la Clerici nella conduzione, un cast fisso che √® la metafora della saggezza popolare: due nonnine e una zia pronte al commento, alla sferzata e a sporcarsi le mani tra i fornelli, limprobabile factotum Alfio insieme al Maestro Panificatore Fulvio Marino. Unallegra compagnia di giro che accompagner√† gli spettatori verso il pranzo, cucinando gomito a gomito con loro, incuriosendo con piccoli tutorial e aneddoti, tastando il polso ad unItalia che si ritrova sempre pi√π bisognosa di leggerezza e gentilezza. Latmosfera √® casalinga ed accogliente: si ride, si commentano i fatti del giorno, si fa del sano gossip, si impara qualcosa, si interagisce con il pubblico da casa e intanto si cucina. Ogni giorno ad aiutare Antonella in cucina ci saranno due cuochi, uno avvezzo alla tv e uno esordiente. Oltre alla cucina e allattualit√†, laltra colonna del programma sono i giochi telefonici con cui gli spettatori possono vincere, di volta in volta, un premio in denaro o un prodotto. Un implicito omaggio alla tv degli anni 80 rivisitato in chiave contemporanea. Durante la settimana ci saranno degli appuntamenti fissi: la fatina dei dolci, il maestro pasticcere pronto a dispensare consigli e tecniche raffinate, lesperto di territorio e di vino, e Angela Frenda, che con la sua rubrica "Ricette damore" racconter√† storie e aneddoti di personaggi famosi. Il tutto mentre sui fuochi bolle il sugo, qualcuno offre una fetta di salame o un caff√®. Proprio come a casa.</desc>

<sub-title>Jung, blond, tot / Die dunkle Seite Hollywoods / Morderische Gier</sub-title>
<desc>Jung, blond, tot - 1977: Eine Collegestudentin wird von ihren Mitbewohnern tot in ihrem Bett aufgefunden. Die junge Frau ist gefesselt und die Kriminaltechniker konnen rasch bestatigen, dass sie vor ihrem Tode vergewaltigt wurde. Es gibt zwar einen Hauptverdachtigen, aber mit der Technik der damaligen Zeit kann dem Mann die Tat nicht zweifelsfrei nachweisen. Mehrere Male in den kommenden Jahren fallt der Mann durch ahnliche Delikte auf, aber nie kann er endgultig verurteilt werden. Ein Beamter jedoch verfolgt den Fall hartnackig. Kann der Verdachtige mit modernen Ermittlungsmethoden schlieSSlich doch uberfuhrt werden? Die dunkle Seite Hollywoods - In einem Canyon nahe Los Angeles wird eine beinahe schon mumifizierte Leiche gefunden. Trotz enormer Gewalteinwirkung auf den Schadel konnen die Forensiker die Identitat des Mannes ermitteln - Roy Radin, ein Broadway Produzent aus New York. Schnell finden die Ermittler heraus, dass Radin mit seiner Geschaftspartnerin Lanie Jacobs in Streit geraten war. Doch Jacobs ist bereits aus Los Angeles verschwunden. Einige Monate spater verhaftet die Polizei einen der Bodyguards Jacobs und kann den Mann in Zusammenhang mit dem Mord bringen. Doch konnen die Beamten beweisen, dass Lanie Jacobs die Tat geplant und beauftragt hat? Morderische Gier - Lakeland, Florida. In einem Wagen wird die Leiche eines Mannes gefunden. Das Auto hat eine Zulassung aus Georgia, uber 400 Kilometer entfernt von Lakeland. Rasch ermitteln die Beamten die Identitat des Mannes, aber was trieb in ihn hierher und wer konnte sein Morder sein? Die Beamten stehen vor einem Ratsel und bitten FBI-Profilerin Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Rasch wird klar, dass es sich bei den Tatern um Profis gehandelt haben muss. Aber aus welchem Grund wurde Robert Brooks getotet? Die Beamten und Hinman hecken einen gewagten Plan aus, um die Morder zu uberfuhren...</desc>

Seine Ehefrau hatte einen letzten telefonischen Kontakt gegen 1 Uhr morgens, danach verliert sich die Spur. Noch verwirrender wird der Fall, als sich ein zwielichtiger CIA-Agent in die Ermittlungen einmischt. Ist Devore auf Grund seiner neuesten Recherchen ermordet worden? Nach einem Jahr findet die Polizei schlieSSlich Devores Leiche mit abgetrennten Handen in einem Abwasserkanal. Konnen die Kriminaltechniker, Forensiker und Beamten das Geheimnis um Devores Tod luften? Im Namen der Liebe - Ein Landvermesser entdeckt eine stark verweste weibliche Leiche in der Nahe von West Palm Beach, Florida. Die Beamten finden eine auffallige Kette, mit deren Hilfe die Tote rasch identifiziert wird, und die Gerichtsmediziner konnen nachweisen, dass der Kopf der Frau mit einer atzenden Flussigkeit ubergossen wurde. Die Tochter der Toten kann sich den Mord nicht erklaren und die Beamten bitten FBI Profilerin Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Rasch wird Hinman klar, dass der unerfahrene Morder das Opfer kannte und die Tat an einem anderen Ort verubt hat. SchlieSSlich wird das Auto des Opfers an einem Flughafen gefunden - und darin Fingerabdrucke eines verurteilten Straftaters. Trotzdem glaubt Hinman nicht an die Schuld des Mannes. Vielmehr vermutet die Profilerin ein personliches Motiv. Doch kann sie ihre Theorie auch beweisen?</desc>

<sub-title>Todliche Gewasser / Blutige FuSSspuren</sub-title>
<desc>Todliche Gewasser - Drei grausame Morde an Frauen erschuttern Palm Beach. Ein Serienmorder treibt sein Unwesen und konnte bisher nicht gestoppt werden. Da wird eine vierte Leiche entdeckt und die Befurchtung steht im Raum, dass der Killer erneut zugeschlagen hat. Die ermittelnden Beamten bitten Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Die erfahrene Profilerin soll klaren, ob Rene Baker ebenfalls dem Serientater zum Opfer fiel. Dale ist sich rasch sicher, dass es sich um einen anderen Tater handeln muss. Die einzige Spur, die dieser am Tatort hinterlassen hat ist ein Zigarettenstummel. Kann der Morder damit uberfuhrt werden? Blutige FuSSspuren - Sabatino Russo und seine Frau Eugenia betreiben ein kleines italienisches Restaurant in Hollywood. Insbesondere die lokalen Polizisten gehoren zu ihren Stammkunden. Umso schockierter sind die Beamten, als sie zur Szenerie eines grausamen Doppelmordes gerufen werden und die beiden Wirtsleute als Opfer vorfinden. Der Tatort gibt Ratsel auf - die Leichen liegen in verschiedenen Zimmern, ein Besenstiel und ein Wischmopp liegen auffallig herum. Beide Opfer wurden geschlagen, aber die Todesursache sind heftige Schnitt- und Stichwunden. Bei der Obduktion finden die Gerichtsmediziner einen Teil eines Messers im Kopf eines der Opfer. Doch sonst gibt es kaum Spuren. Alleine die drei neuen Bodensafes, die das Paar hatte einbauen lassen, geben einen Hinweis. Wer wusste von diesen Safes? Und kann derjenige dann auch mit den Morden in Verbindung gebracht werden?</desc>

Die Spulmaschine muss korrekt eingeraumt sein, es muss alles an seinem Platz stehen, selbst fur das Aufhangen der Wasche gibt es eine Ordnung. Und wenn die nicht eingehalten wird, rappelt es im Karton. Die Tochter Saskia (18) und Monique (14) stecken in der Pubertat und streiten fur ihr Leben gern. Gepaart mit Franks Geiz bedeutet das fur Elke, dass sie immer zuruckstecken muss. Der Traum von einer Mitgliedschaft im Fitnessstudio wird fur die Backereifachverkauferin wohl ewig ein Traum bleiben. Doch Elke denkt endlich mal an sich und wagt den Sprung in den "Frauentausch". Jetzt tauscht die ordnungsliebende Elke in die bunte Welt der drei Dragqueens. Auf alle Beteiligten wartet eine spannende Zeit.</desc>

<title>Frauentausch</title>
<desc>Sabine bedeuten ihre drei Tochter alles. Auch wenn es mit Madels im Alter von elf bis 16 Jahren auch mal Zank und Zoff gibt, lasst Sabine sich nicht aus der Ruhe bringen. Die 35-Jahrige will ihren Tochtern nicht nur Mutter, sondern auch Freundin sein. Die Erziehung muss Sabine aber alleine meistern, denn von ihrem Mann hat sie sich schon lange getrennt und ein neuer Ersatzpapi wird derzeit nicht gesucht. Da Sabine nicht arbeiten will, solange ihre Kinder noch zuhause sind, ist das Geld knapp. Aber das Quartett ist sparsam. Schicke Sachen gibt es auch gunstig und mit den Erfahrungen aus ihrer Friseurlehre bandigt Sabine auch den wildesten Schopf. Der Damenhaushalt funktioniert gut, Sabine und die Kinder verbringen viel Zeit gemeinsam und machen es sich mit bescheidenen Mitteln so schon es geht. Carmen (46) und ihr neun Jahre jungerer Mann Ralf haben sich ihren groSSen Traum erfullt und ein schickes Eigenheim gebaut. Das Geld dazu verdienen beide, Ralf mit Softwareentwicklung, Carmen mit Telefonsex. Ein Problem mit Carmens Beruf hat Ralf nicht, eher ist das Thema Hundeerziehung ein Streitpunkt zwischen den beiden. Das Paar liebt seine sechskopfige Hundemeute, deren Erziehung Ralf, Carmens Meinung nach, etwas zu lasch angeht. Jetzt tauschen die extrovertierte Hundebesitzerin Carmen und die dreifache Mutter Sabine fur zehn Tage die Familien. Wie kommt Sabine mit Carmens Mann und der groSSen Hundemeute zurecht? Und was erlebt Carmen bei Sabines drei pubertierenden Tochtern?</desc>

Als der Dieb sie angreift, geschieht Wundersames... Eine Blume als Zeuge - Fur den Mord an einem Blumenhandler gibt es weder Zeugen noch ein Tatmotiv. Deshalb schlagt Detektiv Parkers Partner Dean einen eigenartigen Test vor: Wahrend seines Studiums wohnte er einem Versuch bei, bei dem sein Professor Pflanzen an einen Lugendetektor angeschlossen hat, um zu beweisen, dass Pflanzen auf AuSSenreize reagieren. Da der Blumenhandler in seinem Laden umgebracht wurde, bestunde doch die Moglichkeit, dass die Pflanzen als "Zeugen" in Frage kamen...

Es dauert nicht lange und Yannick zieht bei Julia und ihrer Tochter Leticia ein. Julia macht von Anfang an kein Geheimnis um ihre Krankheit: Julia leidet an dem Gendefekt HMSN Typ 1, eine Nervenkrankheit, die durch Muskelschwund gekennzeichnet ist. Yannick will fur seine kleine Familie sorgen und so geben Julia und Yannick sich im Februar 2015 das Ja-Wort und kaufen ein Haus, um sich dort eine gemeinsame Zukunft aufzubauen. Yannick beginnt das Haus zu renovieren, auch um den Bedurfnissen von Julia gerecht zu werden und ihr einen Ruckzugsort zu schaffen. Das Schlafzimmer und Wohnzimmer im Erdgeschoss kann er noch fertigstellen, bevor 2015 das Schicksal bei der jungen Familie zuschlagt: Yannick hat auf dem Heimweg einen schweren Autounfall, weil er am Steuer einschlaft. Die √Ñrzte stellen die Diagnose: Narkolepsie. Bei dieser neurologischen Erkrankung leiden die Patienten unter Einschlafattacken. Die Diagnose ist ein schwerer Schlag fur die ganze Familie, denn seither ist Yannick arbeitsunfahig. Der junge Mann ist am Ende seiner Krafte und muss sich von der Vorstellung losen das Haus in Eigenleistung fur seine Familie umbauen zu konnen. Dabei braucht die junge Familie den Platz mehr denn je, denn im Oktober 2015 kommt Yannicks und Julias gemeinsame Tochter Lilith zur Welt. Derzeit spielt sich das Leben der vierkopfigen Familie nur im Erdgeschoss ab, da sich die obere Etage, auf der die zukunftigen Kinderzimmer liegen, im Rohbau befindet. Weder Yannick noch Julia haben einen Raum, in den sie sich zuruckziehen oder sich ausruhen konnen.

<desc>Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Halle an der Saale - drei deutsche GroSSstadte, drei soziale Brennpunkte. Gibt es sie wirklich, die deutschen No-Go-Areas? Wie unsicher ist es, nachts durch das beruchtigte Frankfurter Bahnhofsviertel zu gehen - in der Stadt, die als die gefahrlichste in Deutschland gilt? Wie ist das Leben am Berliner "Kotti", am Kottbusser Tor? Jeden Tag passiert hier durchschnittlich eine Korperverletzung oder Raubtat. Unterwegs mit drei Reportern. Das stern TV Spezial "Leben im Brennpunkt - Das Experiment" beantwortet all diese Fragen: hautnah und spannend. In jeder Stadt bezieht ein Reporter eine Wohnung inmitten eines kriminellen Hotspots und macht sich vor Ort ein personliches Bild, spricht mit Kriminellen, trifft auf besorgte Anwohner und begleitet Streetworker. So gefahrlich sind Deutschlands soziale Brennpunkte wirklich!</desc>

<desc>F√• svenska artister har lamnat ett s√• oforglomligt avtryck som Freddie Wadling (1951-2016) - och f√• ar lika mytomspunna. Med en rost som strackte sig fr√•n de djupaste brunnarna till de himmelska hojderna, benamndes han ofta som "Sveriges basta rockrost". Filmen utforskar Wadlings morka livsode och fascinerande karriar - fr√•n hans tid med band som Cortex, Blue for Two och Flaskkvartetten, till hans solokarriar som omfattade allt fr√•n elektronisk musik till finstamda visor. Trots sin kultstatus kampade Wadling med scenskrack och ett liv praglat av alkohol och droger. En revanschhistoria om en utstott kille som fick ett oerhort anseende och skrev in sig i den svenska musikhistorien. Svensk dokumentar fr√•n 2025 av Lars Hogeus och Robert Lagerstrom.</desc>

<title>Jag ar monstret _ filmen om Freddie Wadling</title>
<desc>F√• svenska artister har lamnat ett s√• oforglomligt avtryck som Freddie Wadling (1951-2016) - och f√• ar lika mytomspunna. Med en rost som strackte sig fr√•n de djupaste brunnarna till de himmelska hojderna, benamndes han ofta som "Sveriges basta rockrost". Filmen utforskar Wadlings morka livsode och fascinerande karriar - fr√•n hans tid med band som Cortex, Blue for Two och Flaskkvartetten, till hans solokarriar som omfattade allt fr√•n elektronisk musik till finstamda visor. Trots sin kultstatus kampade Wadling med scenskrack och ett liv praglat av alkohol och droger. En revanschhistoria om en utstott kille som fick ett oerhort anseende och skrev in sig i den svenska musikhistorien. Svensk dokumentar fr√•n 2025 av Lars Hogeus och Robert Lagerstrom.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<title>Sans frapper</title>
<desc>Ada avait 19 ans quand elle a subi une agression sexuelle, mais elle na depose plainte que dix ans plus tard. De son temoignage interprete par quatorze hommes et femmes, √† la premi√®re comme √† la troisi√®me personne, emerge le vecu empathique dun traumatisme qui tisse la possibilite dun "nous". Qestions taboues Peut-on se mettre √† la place dune victime de violence sexuelle ? La realisatrice Alexe Poukine traite du recit du viol, douloureux passage oblige pour les personnes agressees et objet de toutes les interpretations sous le poids des stereotypes, des prejuges et du patriarcat... Dans la bouche des differents interpr√®tes, lhistoire dAda ‚àí √† laquelle dautres aussi effroyablement banales font echo ‚àí devient universelle, mais se charge aussi de doute et de suspicion, pla√ßant le telespectateur dans linconfortable et derangeante position de juge, et lobligeant √† explorer ses propres a priori. Car, au fil du film, des questions intimes restees taboues affleurent : ai-je le droit de metre sentie depossedee de mon corps au cours dune telle experience ? Puis-je en parler ? Que signifie le consentement pour moi ? Entrela√ßant voix et visages, mots et maux, dans un montage delicat, Sans frapper repond au jeu devastateur de labus de pouvoir par un autre jeu, benefique et porteur despoir : celui dune communaute qui sexprime.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

Son travail permet de retrouver les objets voles, proposes √† la vente sur internet, et de les restituer. En Mediterranee, larcheologue sous-marine Franca Cibecchini dirige des fouilles durgence destinees √† sauver les tresors dune epave, le Fort Royal, echoue il y a plus de 2 000 ans au large de Cannes. Un site aux richesses inestimables. Des trafics amplifies par les guerres et les conflits‚Ä¶ En Libye, le superbe site de Cyr√®ne, classe √† lUnesco, sest vu depouille de nombreux tresors, notamment pendant les printemps arabes. Larcheologue Vincent Michel part √† la recherche des sculptures pillees et dispersees √† travers le monde. Depuis toujours, les faussaires jettent une ombre sur le marche de lart. Exceptionnellement, le Louvre ouvre ses reserves et rev√®le les faux dont il a malheureusement fait lacquisition : une copie de Denner, peintre du XVIIIe si√®cle, et une tiare en or, plus vraie que nature, achetee √† tort par le departement des objets archeologiques √† la fin du XIXe si√®cle.</desc>

<title>El crimen de Cuenca</title>
<desc>Dos amigos de la localidad conquense de Osa de la Vega son detenidos como autores de la muerte de su compa√±ero, el pastor Jose Mar√≠a Grimaldos. Tras ser torturados, los amigos confiesan un crimen que no han cometido y son juzgados y condenados a dieciocho a√±os de c√°rcel. Segunda cinta dirigida por Pilar Miro y una de las que m√°s problemas le causaron, pues fue la primera pel√≠cula "secuestrada" tras la desaparicion de la censura durante la Transicion y estuvo casi un a√±o y medio prohibida. Protagonizado por Jose Manuel Cervino, Daniel Dicenta, Amparo Soler, Hector Alterio y Guillermo Montesinos, el filme est√° basada en los hechos reales ocurridos en 1910 en el peque√±o pueblo de Osa de la Vega (Cuenca), donde dos hombres inocentes fueron acusados del asesinato de un pastor que, como se descubrio despues, segu√≠a con vida. Una historia que gira en torno a una humillacion, una amistad, un error y una indigna manera de actuar de la justicia.</desc>

<title>Armasta, ara unusta</title>
<desc>37-aastane Marina elab nagu tavaline tanapaeva lahutatud naine: kasvatab uksi 12-aastast tutart ja tootab kunstikoolis √µpetajana. Marinale naib, et tema elu on juba elatud ja midagi uut enam tulemas pole. Kuid k√µik muutub, kui naine tutvub juhuslikult Nikitaga. Noormees armub temasse esimesest pilgust ja teeb k√µik, et olla oma armastatu k√µrval. Kuid paraku on ta k√µigest 20-aastane. Vanusevahe Nikitat ei hairi, ta on valmis Marinaga abielluma. Kuid Marina kardab ja on kindel, et tema tutvuskond ei liida seda heaks. Naine on kahevahel ja p√µgeneb l√µpuks oma meeletu armastuse eest lapsep√µlvelinna. Marina vanemad viivad ta kokku oma uue naabri Igoriga. Igor on kindlameelne, vastutustundlik, Marinasse armunud ja mis p√µhiline, temaga uhevanune. Marina on n√µus saama Igori naiseks. Kuid kas Nikita loobub oma armastatud naisest?</desc>

<desc>Iraani draama, mis v√µitis Cannesi filmifestivalil Grand Prix. Rahim on sumpaatse olekuga meesterahvas, kes satub vangi, sest ei suuda v√µlga tagasi maksta. Ta saab vanglast paariks paevaks valja ja puuab selle ajaga laenuandjaga asjad ara klaarida. √úks asi viib teiseni ja peagi on Rahimist saanud sotsiaalmeedia abil kangelane. See ei tee aga ei tema olukorda ega enesetunnet kuidagi paremaks‚Ä¶ Asghar Farhadi ("Lahkuminek") kirjutatud ja lavastatud film raagib filosoofilise ning teravmeelse m√µistuloo kangelaseks olemise suhtelisusest.</desc>

<title>Kangelane</title>
<desc>Iraani draama, mis v√µitis Cannesi filmifestivalil Grand Prix. Rahim on sumpaatse olekuga meesterahvas, kes satub vangi, sest ei suuda v√µlga tagasi maksta. Ta saab vanglast paariks paevaks valja ja puuab selle ajaga laenuandjaga asjad ara klaarida. √úks asi viib teiseni ja peagi on Rahimist saanud sotsiaalmeedia abil kangelane. See ei tee aga ei tema olukorda ega enesetunnet kuidagi paremaks‚Ä¶ Asghar Farhadi ("Lahkuminek") kirjutatud ja lavastatud film raagib filosoofilise ning teravmeelse m√µistuloo kangelaseks olemise suhtelisusest.</desc>

Soov oma patte lunastada ning minevikuga l√µpparve teha seab aga ohtu nii Blocki tutre kui tutretutre. Kes julgeb ahvardada sellise mehele k√µige kallimaid inimesi, sel on ilmselt eluisu otsas.</desc>

Grundlage sind zwei Milliardenpakete voller Schulden und eine 180-Grad-Wende des CDU-Chefs Friedrich Merz. Noch ist vollig unklar, wie die gigantische Neuverschuldung fur Infrastruktur und das Ausnehmen der Verteidigungsausgaben von der Schuldenbremse oberhalb 1 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes im Detail gestaltet werden sollen. Klar ist aber: Union und SPD brauchen zwingend die Grunen, um die Gesetzesanderungen noch im alten Bundestag beschlieSSen zu konnen. Wird das ohne Zugestandnisse gehen? Ist das in der Kurze der Zeit uberhaupt noch verhandelbar? Nicht nur die Opposition, auch Wirtschaftsexperten und Juristen haben groSSe Zweifel an den Planen angemeldet.</desc>

<title>Zehn Tage allein mit Papa</title>
<desc>Isabelle, Antoine und ihre Kinder bekommen unerwartet einen Luxusskiurlaub geschenkt. Doch als Isabelle aus beruflichen Grunden daheimbleibt, artet der Trip unter Papas Aufsicht vollends aus. Antoine verbannt die Kinder zwar schnell in den Skiunterricht, jedoch bringen ein verhasster Ex-Kollege sowie das Liebesinteresse einer Fremden den auf Skiern talentfreien Vater anderweitig ins Wanken. - Fortsetzung der Erfolgskomodie "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" Familie Mercier hat sich fortschrittlich organisiert: Wahrend Isabelle (Aure Atika) vor kurzem eine Anwaltskanzlei gegrundet hat, kummert sich Antoine (Franck Dubosc) als Hausmann um die Kinder Arthur (Swan Joulin), Chloe (Violette Guillon), Maxime (Ilan Debrabant) und Jojo (Evan Paturel). Auf Einladung von Steevy (Bertrand Uzeel), dem neuen Ehemann von Isabelles Schwester Audrey (Helena Noguerra), erhalt die Familie die Chance zu einem Luxusskiurlaub in Courchevel. Doch als bei Isabelle am Abreisetag ihr lang ersehnter erster Gerichtsfall eingeht, bleibt die Mutter kurzfristig zu Hause. Hilflos macht sich Antoine alleine mit den Kindern auf, die das Luxuskettenhotel aus der Familie ihres neuen Schwagers schnell auf den Kopf zu stellen wissen. Zwar kann Antoine seinen Nachwuchs tagsuber in der angeschlossenen Skischule abgeben, doch neben seinen eigenen, ungelenken Fahrversuchen muss sich der Familienvater plotzlich mit einem alten Bekannten herumschlagen. Sein groSSspuriger Ex-Arbeitskollege Thierry Di Caprio (Alexis Michalik) will vor Ort mit Immobiliengeschaften einen neuen Sektor fur seinen Arbeitgeber erschlieSSen. Antoine entwickelt den Wunsch, selbst wieder Geld zu verdienen. Daruber hinaus hat die alleinstehende Laure (Annelise Hesme) ein Auge auf Antoine geworfen, was auch der Nachzuglerin Isabelle nicht vorenthalten bleibt. Nach "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" landete der franzosische Regisseur Ludovic Bernard in seiner Heimat auch mit der Fortsetzung "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" einen Kinoerfolg, wenngleich er dieses Mal nicht die Millionenmarke bei den Zuschauern knacken konnte. Gedreht wurde die Familienkomodie in dem bekannten Skigebiet Courchevel. Im Presseheft des Films beschreibt Bernard den Dreh als beinahe Urlaubserfahrung. So wurde auch in Drehpausen fleiSSig Ski gefahren oder die eine oder andere Schneeballschlacht ausgefochten. Stilistisch macht sich "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" sein im Vergleich zu seinem Vorgangerfilm gewandeltes Setting ebenfalls zunutze, denn der Film kommt noch slapstickhafter daher und schopft dabei das (korperliche) Potenzial seines Wintersportambiente voll aus.

<sub-title>Eine Pleite mit Gewinn</sub-title>
<desc>Ein Angler entdeckt im See eine Leiche. Die Kommissare Hansen und Stadler ermitteln. Wie sich herausstellt, handelt es sich bei dem Toten um den Fischer Boris Staufer. Staufer hat zusammen mit seinem Partner Erwin Loibl die Fischerei Rosenheim GbR betrieben. Allerdings hat die Fischerei vor zwei Wochen ihr Geschaft eingestellt und befindet sich in der Abwicklung. Grund fur die Pleite ist ein asiatischer Flusskrebs. Dieser hat sich namlich stark vermehrt und den Fischbestand so dezimiert, dass sich das Fischen nicht mehr lohnte, wie Erwin Loibl den Kommissaren erklart. Ein erster Verdacht fallt auf die Buchhalterin Christine Pfaff, denn Boris Staufer hatte bei der Abwicklung herausgefunden, dass sie die Fischerei seit Jahren um Geld betrogen hat und mit einer Anzeige rechnen musste. Auch der Bootsschreiner Silvio Grothe konnte es gewesen sein, denn er hatte mit der Ehefrau des Opfers ein Verhaltnis und hat sich kurz vor Staufers Tod mit ihm geprugelt. In diesem Zusammenhang gerat auch Claudia Staufer, die Ehefrau des Opfers, in Verdacht, die sich womoglich durch einen Mord fur sich und ihren Liebhaber ein neues Leben erhofft hat. Marie hat fur eine Imagekampagne fur Rosenheim die Ex-Weltmeisterin im Skilaufen, Lore Munchberger, gewinnen konnen. Die reist einen Tag fruher an als erwartet und entpuppt sich als wahres Energie- und Organisationswunder. Jo und Mohr werden misstrauisch.</desc>

<sub-title>Wer sorgt fur unsere Sicherheit? Das Comeback des Bunkers</sub-title>
<desc>Theoretisch gibt es in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Schutzraume fur 480.000 Menschen. Das entspricht etwa 0,56 % der Bevolkerung. Praktisch lautet die Zahl der Platze jedoch: Null. Denn im Zweifel ist keine der 579 Bunkeranlagen einsatzbereit. Es gibt kein Wasser oder keinen Strom, die Bunker werden vermietet, wurden verkauft oder sind seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gewartet. Deutschland steht in Sachen Zivilschutz blank da. Nach 1990 wurden alle Atomschutzanlagen auSSer Dienst gestellt, die ubrigen Bunkeranlagen zu Geld gemacht, eingemottet oder zu Wohnungen oder Kultureinrichtungen umgewidmet. Als ware mit der deutschen Wiedervereinigung eine √Ñra des ewigen Friedens angebrochen. Das Bundesamt fur Bevolkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe verweist auf U-Bahnhofe oder Keller, in die sich die Bevolkerung bei Bedarf fluchten soll. SchlieSSlich sei die Qualitat des Bauens in Deutschland auSSergewohnlich hoch. Nicht alle wollen sich mit solchen Beschwichtigungen zufriedenzugeben. Seit Beginn des Kriegs in der Ukraine boomt der private Bunkerbau. "√úber 70 Prozent unserer Kundschaft sind Frauen", sagt Mario Piejde von der Berliner Firma BSSD. Vor dem Hintergrund der gestiegenen Kriegsgefahr und taglich wachsender Zweifel an der Einsatzbereitschaft der Bundeswehr und NATO widmet sich "aspekte" dem Comeback des Bunkers. 80 Jahre nach Ende des 2. Weltkriegs steigt "aspekte" in alte Bunker, besichtigt neue Bunker und wundert sich uber nicht vorhandene Bunker. Jo Schuck erkundet mit dem Verein "Berliner Unterwelten" die Spuren des Luftkriegs unter dem Pflaster der Hauptstadt und spricht mit dem Militarhistoriker Sonke Neitzel uber die aktuelle Kriegsgefahr. Architekt Andreas Knapp fuhrt durch den zum Kulturort umgebauten Bilker Bunker in Dusseldorf, ein ehemaliger NVA-Kommandant gibt Einblicke in die groSSte Bunkeranlage Deutschlands. Den Stollenkomplex bei Halberstadt, den KZ-Haftlinge einst in den Berg getrieben haben, wollte ein sachsischer Immobilienunternehmer zu luxuriosen Schutzraumen umbauen. Weil die Anlage unter Denkmalschutz steht, muss er seine Plane nun deutlich abspecken. DJ Paula Schopf steht regelmaSSig auf der Buhne des Deutschen Theaters Berlin ("Mein Herz dein Bunker - 290 BPM") und kann sich noch gut erinnern, wie die junge Techno-Szene Anfang der 90er-Jahre in Bunkern ihren Freiraum fand. Anselm Kiefer, der vor 80 Jahren in einem Luftschutzkeller geboren wurde, und Regisseur Joshua Oppenheimer ("The End"), der ein Bunker-Musical mit Tilda Swinton ins Kino bringt, fragt "aspekte" nach der Sinnhaftigkeit der neuen Bunkerwelle: Was nutzt der schonste Bunker, wenn vor den Bunkerturen die Welt untergeht?</desc>

<desc>Maik G. aus Unterwellenborn ist mit dem Fahrrad unterwegs. Auf dem Heimweg verschwindet der Junge. Die Suche fuhrt Kommissar Moller zu einem kleinen See auSSerhalb des Ortes. Dort finden Kinder 1996 Maiks Rad. Kurz darauf wird in einer Scheune seine Leiche entdeckt. Erst, als die Polizei den See ein zweites Mal absucht und abpumpen lasst, findet sie einen braunen Pullover. Fuhrt er auf die Spur des Taters? Wahrend der laufenden Ermittlungen wird die Familie G. aus Unterwellenborn durch weitere Schicksalsschlage erschuttert. Maiks Schwester und seine Mutter werden Opfer eines gewaltsamen Totungsdeliktes. Stehen die beiden Falle miteinander in Verbindung?

Vom Rest der Leiche fehlt zunachst jede Spur. Die Obduktion lasst allerdings darauf schlieSSen, dass alle Extremitaten fachmannisch abgetrennt wurden. Die Polizei ist davon uberzeugt, dass der Tater professionelles Know-how besitzen muss. Tatsachlich verdichten sich die Hinweise auf einen Fleischermeister und seinen Sohn aus Vienenburg. Die Doku-Serie "Ermittler!" begleitet Kommissare, Staatsanwalte und Rechtsmediziner bei der Losung ihrer spektakularsten Falle. Erstmals offnen sie dafur ihre Ermittlungsakten und zeigen Tatortfotos und Polizeivideos. Und sie berichten, wie sie den Tatern auf die Spur gekommen sind.</desc>

<title>Wilde Zeiten. Das letzte Jahr der DDR</title>
<desc>Als 1989 die Mauer fallt, ist nichts mehr so wie vorher. Das Jahr bis zur Wiedervereinigung ist wild, verruckt und chaotisch. Keiner weiSS, was die Zukunft bringt, alles scheint moglich. Nach 40 Jahren sozialistischer Diktatur bricht plotzlich die staatliche Kontrolle weg. Viele DDR-Burger fuhlen sich befreit, viele aber auch verunsichert und allein gelassen. Im ganzen Land herrscht eine Stimmung zwischen Aufbruch und Die Ersturmung der Stasi-Zentrale in Ostberlin geht um die Welt. Aber die Burger der DDR raumen auch anderswo auf. Parteichefs, Burgermeister, Schuldirektoren werden aus ihren √Ñmtern gefegt. Die Volkspolizei ist hochstens noch geduldet, langst nicht mehr respektiert. In Ostberlin tanzen Tausende in verlassenen Kellern am Todesstreifen, ehemaligen Bunkern und Industrieruinen. Techno wird das groSSe Freiheitserlebnis, vereint Ossis und Wessis in Trance. Auch Wohnungsbesetzungen sind ein Phanomen dieser Zeit. Allein in Berlin entstehen im Sommer 1990 uber 100 solcher "Hausprojekte". Freiheit, endlich auch beim Thema Sex: √úberall in der noch-DDR schieSSen Sexshops aus dem Boden. Mit Dildos, Pornofilmen und Dessous erzielen die neuen Erotikladen Rekordverkaufe. Der Kaufrausch nach bunten Waren aus dem Westen macht auch vor Gebrauchtwagen nicht Halt. Schrottautos aus dem Westen werden zu vollig uberhohten Preisen im Osten verhokert. "Wenn sie rosten, ab in den Osten!", heiSSt es unter Autohandlern. Zeitzeugen aus Ost und West, darunter die Schauspielerin Christiane Paul und Jimmy Hartwig, damals erster FuSSball-Trainer aus dem Westen in der DDR, berichten uber die "Wilden Zeiten" im Jahr nach dem Mauerfall.</desc>

<sub-title>√Ñgypten - Natur schreibt Geschichte</sub-title>
<desc>Welche Krafte haben das alte √Ñgypten gepragt. Was waren die Grunde fur Aufstieg, Wohlstand und den dramatischen Niedergang des Pharaonenreichs? Naturgewalten spielten eine entscheidende Rolle. Hannah Emde reist zu gigantischen Tierskeletten in der Wuste, steigt nachts in uralte Grabkammern, versucht eine Kobra zu fangen und hilft mit bei einer Ausgrabung auf einer Insel im Nil. Der Nil: Lebensader und Schicksalsfluss Hannah Emde, Tierarztin, Artenschutzerin und Moderatorin von "Faszination Erde", macht sich in √Ñgypten auf eine spannende Reise. Sie beginnt auf dem Nil, der Lebensader √Ñgyptens - heute wie damals. Wie sicherte dieser machtige Fluss im alten √Ñgypten den Wohlstand des Landes? Die regelmaSSig auftretenden Fluten des Nils waren die Grundbedingung fur eine florierende Landwirtschaft. Doch die Natur ist launisch. Erst durch Innovationen gelang es, den Fluss zu zahmen. Nilometer, ausgeklugelte Bewasserungssysteme und ein tiefer Respekt vor der Natur halfen den √Ñgyptern, ihre Felder optimal zu bewirtschaften. Klimawandel in der Antike Hannah Emde erfahrt von gewaltigen Klimaveranderungen, die die Region im Laufe der Jahrtausende geformt haben: Das Kippen der Erdachse lieSS einst die Sahara in eine grune Savanne erbluhen, die erst spater zur Wuste wurde. So trieb die Natur die Menschen in neue Lebensraume - immer auf der Suche nach Wasser und fruchtbaren Boden. Das Niltal war wie ein Magnet fur die Menschen. Es war der fruhe Beginn der Entwicklung zur agyptischen Hochkultur. Naturkatastrophen und der Untergang der Pharaonen In den eisigen Tiefen Gronlands entdecken Forschende Beweise fur ein Naturereignis, das √Ñgyptens Schicksal besiegelte: Ein gewaltiger Vulkanausbruch auf den Aleuten-Inseln vor Alaska im Jahr 43 v. Chr. sorgte fur globale Klimaveranderungen. Die Fluten des Nils blieben aus, Durren und Hungersnote trieben viele Menschen in den Tod - ein Schicksalsschlag, den das Reich der Pharaonen nicht uberlebte. Die Kraft der Natur - gestern und heute Hannah Emde zeigt, dass die Geschichte √Ñgyptens nicht allein von Menschen geschrieben wurde. Es waren die Krafte der Natur - Wasser, Wind, Sand, Vulkane und das Klima - die den Lauf der Dinge immer wieder veranderten. Die Frage drangt sich auf: Welche Rolle wird die Natur in unserer eigenen Zukunft spielen? Drei Folgen "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Die beiden ersten Folgen steht bereits ab dem 5. Marz 2025 vorab in der ZDFmediathek zur Verfugung.</desc>

<title>Wunderwelt Chemie</title>
<sub-title>Die Bausteine der Natur</sub-title>
<desc>Woraus besteht die Welt? Diese Frage fasziniert Menschen seit jeher. Dr. Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim nimmt die Zuschauer mit auf eine Reise durch die Geschichte der Wissenschaft. In der Antike ging man von vier Elementen aus: Feuer, Wasser, Erde und Luft. Nach Jahrhunderten der Forschung sind heute 118 Elemente bekannt - und die Suche geht weiter. Entdeckt wurden sie von visionaren Mannern und Frauen, die Wissenschaftsgeschichte schrieben. Dass Festes flussig und Flussiges zu Gas werden konnte, inspirierte die fruhen Alchemisten, eine solche Verwandlungskunst selbst anzuwenden. Meist auf der Suche nach dem "Stein der Weisen", der unedle Metalle in Gold umwandeln sollte. Auch wenn alle Versuche ins Leere liefen, erbrachte doch mancher Irrweg wichtige Erkenntnisse. So der von Hennig Brand, der im Jahr 1669 versuchte, den Stein der Weisen aus Urin zu gewinnen, und dabei den Phosphor entdeckte. Viele Elemente wurden erst nach einer Kette von Irrtumern gefunden. Wie die Entdeckung des Sauerstoffs durch den Franzosen Antoine de Lavoisier, der damit die abenteuerliche Theorie des "Phlogistons" widerlegte, eines ominosen Stoffes, von dem man angenommen hatte, er entweiche bei Verbrennungen. 118 Elemente fuhrt das Periodensystem heute auf. Es ist nicht weniger als die Ordnung der Welt, die in Spalten und Gruppen nach der Kernladung und den chemischen Eigenschaften der Elemente aufgegliedert ist. Dieses Grundverstandnis verdankt die Wissenschaft dem Russen Dimitri Mendelejew, dem das Periodensystem der Legende nach im Traum erschien. Seine Leistung besteht nicht nur aus der Ordnung der bekannten Elemente, die er erstmals 1869 der √ñffentlichkeit prasentierte, sondern auch in der Definition der Leerstellen im Periodensystem. Er prophezeite, dass es dort noch Elemente geben musse, auch wenn man sie zu seiner Zeit noch nicht kannte. Mendelejew sollte recht behalten. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts begann erstmals eine Frau, die Lucken des Periodensystems zu fullen: Marie Curie. Sie entdeckte die Elemente Radium und Polonium. Bis zuletzt war sie vom Nutzen der radioaktiven Strahlung uberzeugt, die von ihnen ausging - etwa fur die Behandlung von Tumoren. Den Abwurf der erste Atombombe hat Curie nicht mehr erlebt. In dieser Folge der Reihe erklart Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim die Grundlagen einer faszinierenden Wissenschaft, der viele Menschen skeptisch gegenuberstehen. "Fur viele ist Chemie nur ein verhasstes Schulfach, das man nicht schnell genug abwahlen konnte, dabei erklart sie uns diese verruckte faszinierende Welt, in der wir leben", sagt die Wissenschaftsjournalistin. Drei Folgen "Terra X: Wunderwelt Chemie - Mit Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Alle Filme der Reihe sind bereits ab Montag, 4. Oktober, in der ZDFmediathek unter terra-X.zdf.de zu finden. Die erste Folge, "Die Bausteine der Natur", wird am Sonntag, 10. Oktober, um 10.00 Uhr auch auf dem YouTube-Kanal "Terra X" https://ly.zdf.de/tl1/ veroffentlicht.

<title>A Breath Away</title>
<desc>Nach einem Erdbeben wird Paris von einem giftigen Nebel heimgesucht, der die Bevolkerung zur Flucht in die Hohe zwingt. Auch Anna, Mathieu und ihre Tochter Sarah kampfen ums √úberleben. Durch eine seltene Immunkrankheit ist Sarah an eine immobile Sauerstoffkammer gebunden. Zur Sicherung ihrer lebensnotwendigen Isolation sind Mathieu und Anna zu allem bereit, wahrend Paris im Nebel und im Chaos versinkt. Sarah (Fantine Harduin), die Tochter der Wissenschaftler Anna (Olga Kurylenko) und Mathieu (Romain Duris), leidet an einer seltenen Immunerkrankung und ist dadurch gezwungen, in einer isolierten Sauerstoffkammer zu leben. Wahrend Mathieu regelmaSSig die Welt auf der Suche nach neuen Therapiemethoden fur Sarah bereist, priorisiert Anna die begrenzte Zeit mit ihrer Tochter. Unangekundigt wird Paris von einem schweren Erdbeben erschuttert, das einen giftigen Nebel freisetzt, der die Metropole zunachst nur bis zu einer bestimmten Hohe verschlingt. Mathieu und Anna finden in ihrem Wohnhaus Zuflucht bei dem alten Ehepaar Lucien (Michel Robin) und Colette (Anna Gaylor) im Dachgeschoss, wahrend Sarah in ihrer vor dem Nebel geschutzten Kammer ausharren muss. Sarahs Eltern sind bald dazu gezwungen, sich fur Besorgungen und die Inganghaltung von Sarahs Isolationskabine nach drauSSen zu wagen. Ob des Ausnahmezustands regiert in den StraSSen von Paris das Chaos. Als der Nebel plotzlich erneut zu steigen beginnt, mussen Mathieu und Anna unvermittelt eine Evakuierung von sich und Sarah vorbereiten. Das emotionale Katastrophendrama "A Breath Away" des kanadischen Regisseurs Daniel Roby konzentriert sich in erster Linie auf die menschlichen Aspekte seines dargestellten Unglucksszenarios. Dadurch grenzt sich die franzosisch-kanadische Produktion ein Stuck weit von den amerikanischen Blockbustern des Genres ab, die ihren Fokus oft auf die groSStmogliche Imposanz ihrer Endzeitbilder legen. Dennoch wurde die Herstellung der Katastrophensituation in "A Breath Away" alles andere als stiefmutterlich angegangen. So wurden beispielsweise fur den im Film omniprasenten Nebel verschiedene Farbtone hinsichtlich ihrer psychologischen Wirkung getestet, um einen moglichst toxischen und bedrohlichen Effekt sicherzustellen.</desc>

<title>Ein starkes Team</title>
<sub-title>Fast perfekte Morde</sub-title>
<desc>Tobias Kaiser, Chef eines Architekturburos, wurde kaltblutig erschossen, nachdem er im Kreise seiner Kollegen einen lukrativen Auftrag gefeiert hatte. Das "starke Team" ermittelt. Schnell stellt sich heraus, dass Kollegin Leyla Gunes den millionenschweren Auftrag an Land gezogen hatte und Kaiser dafur die Lorbeeren ernten wollte. Hat sie ihren Chef aus Rache erschossen, weil sie insgeheim hoffte, seinen Posten ubernehmen zu konnen? Otto und Linett finden heraus, dass Kaiser vor Kurzem in einen heftigen Streit verwickelt war, der offenbar handgreiflich endete: Hanna Beckmann hat als Praktikantin in Kaisers Architekturburo gearbeitet, bis zur absoluten Erschopfung. Ihr Vater, Julius Beckmann, scheint ein Mann furs Grobe zu sein. Hat er Kaiser gegenuber die Kontrolle verloren, als er ihn fur sein Fehlverhalten zur Rechenschaft ziehen wollte? Je tiefer das "starke Team" in diesen komplizierten Fall eintaucht, desto mehr potenzielle Tatverdachtige gibt es. Plotzlich wendet sich das Blatt, als Otto und Linett in einem weiteren Mordfall ermitteln mussen: Barkeeper Timo Feldkamp wird nach seiner Schicht in seiner eigenen Bar erschossen. Zunachst scheinen die beiden Taten in keinem Zusammenhang zu stehen, jedoch finden die Ermittler heraus, dass Feldkamp eine Affare mit Leyla Gunes hatte. Gibt es also doch eine Verbindung zwischen den beiden Morden? "Ein starkes Team - Fast perfekte Morde" ist bereits eine Woche vor der Ausstrahlung in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar.</desc>
