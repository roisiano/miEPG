<title>Das war nicht mehr ich</title>
<desc>Die 20-jahrige Laura will beim Prasidium einer kleinen bretonischen Hafenstadt eine Anzeige wegen Vergewaltigung gegen den frisch ernannten Minister Quentin Le Bars aufgeben. Die Beamten reagieren jedoch skeptisch auf ihre Anschuldigungen gegen den Politiker. Laura lasst sich nicht entmutigen und beginnt zu erzahlen, wie es zu den √úbergriffen gekommen ist. Ruckblick: Nachdem sie erfolglos in Paris ihr Gluck versucht hat, ist Laura wieder bei ihrem Vater Max untergekommen, einem ehemaligen Box-Champion, der in einem kleinen Haus direkt am Meer wohnt. Dieser arbeitet seit einigen Jahren als Chauffeur fur den ortlichen Burgermeister Quentin Le Bars, den er um Hilfe bei der Suche nach einer Wohnung fur Laura bittet. Der 48-jahrige Burgermeister verspricht, sich darum zu kummern. Kurz darauf hat Laura einen Termin mit ihm in seinem Buro. Schon das erste Aufeinandertreffen bereitet Laura ein mulmiges Gefuhl. Der Burgermeister kommt ihr auffallig nah - Laura hat das Gefuhl, sie wird von ihm mit Blicken ausgezogen. Aber sie nimmt es hin. Er ist ein machtiger Mann. Vielleicht ist es so ublich. Quentin organisiert ihr alsbald im nahe gelegenen Casino eine Wohnung und eine Arbeitsstelle als Barkeeperin. Die Wohnung gefallt Laura sehr - und auch da sie keine andere Option hat, sagt sie zu. Bereits am nachsten Tag wird der hohe Preis fur die Gefalligkeit des Burgermeisters offenbar: Der erste √úbergriff findet statt. Von nun an besucht sie der Burgermeister regelmaSSig in ihrer Wohnung. Laura geht es von Tag zu Tag schlechter. Auf der Arbeit wird ihre Verfassung wahrgenommen, doch niemand sagt etwas. Alle sehen weg. Ihr Vater kriegt davon nichts mit, er ist mit seinem bevorstehenden Comeback als Boxer beschaftigt. SchlieSSlich macht Lauras Chefin Hel√®ne, eine fruhere Bekannte von Max, ihm gegenuber Andeutungen. Aber gibt es einen Ausweg fur Vater und Tochter?</desc>

<desc>Fur Christian Paigneau war die Begegnung mit der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle wie Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Funf Jahre lang sah er sich samtliche Filme an, ohne auch nur ein Wort zu verstehen - aber die Bilder sprachen ihn an. Ihm wurde klar, dass die Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher gelernt hatten, sich mehr durch Bilder auszudrucken als durch Worte, weil sie in einem totalitaren Regime lebten. Genau darin liegt die Kraft der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle. Diese Filme finden immer einen Weg, ihre Botschaft zu ubermitteln, zum Beispiel durch ein Gefuhl oder eine bestimmte Atmosphare. Es entsteht ein intensiver Dialog mit dem Zuschauer. Milan Kundera erzahlte Paigneau von seiner Zeit als Dozent an der Film- und Fernsehfakultat der Akademie der musischen Kunste in Prag (FAMU). Die Fakultat, die zahlreiche Mitglieder der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle hervorbrachte, war damals ein freigeistiger Ort und forderte die Entstehung einer Gegenkultur. Doch die Geschichte hat auch ihre Schattenseiten: Filme, die uber 20 Jahre hinweg verboten waren, Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher im Exil, eine gespaltene Kinokultur zwischen Tschechien und der Slowakei und die Frage, warum zahlreiche Meisterwerke im Westen lange nicht gezeigt werden konnten. Der Dokumentarfilm erzahlt die Geschichte einer gescheiterten Filmbewegung. Er handelt vom geteilten Schicksal der Filmschaffenden und ihrem Verhaltnis zur Zensur. Gleichzeitig wird die Bewegung durch die Laufbahn des jungen Schriftstellers Jan Prochazka - einer der bekanntesten Personlichkeiten des Prager Fruhlings - von einer anderen Seite beleuchtet. Die einen uben mit ihren Filmen scharfe Regimekritik, der andere ist Mitglied im Zentralkomitee der Kommunistischen Partei und will das System von innen heraus verandern. Doch 1968 kommt die "Normalisierung" und mit ihr die Niederschlagung des freien Denkens ‚Ä¶</desc>

<desc>Mongolen, die Ming- und die Qing-Dynastie, das Britische Empire oder kommunistische Rebellen - China erlebte im Laufe seiner langen Geschichte viele Kriege, Eroberungen und auslandische Invasionen. Doch mit der Grundung der Volksrepublik im Jahr 1949 durch Mao Zedong ging das Land in die Offensive: Annexion und die Kolonisierung von Xinjiang, Eroberung und Unterdruckung Tibets, Koreakrieg, Konflikt mit Indien und Strafexpedition im Vietnam - die Liste ist lang.

<desc>Sommer, 1958: General de Gaulle hat die Nase voll - die Franzosen sind undankbar, die Politiker inkompetent. Der Befreier der franzosischen Nation gonnt sich erst mal einen wohlverdienten Urlaub. Die Serie "De Gaulle am Strand", eine werktreue Adaption der gleichnamigen Comicreihe von Jean-Yves Ferri, kratzt mit herrlich absurdem Humor am Ruhmeslack des groSSen Helden der franzosischen Geschichte. Der mal subtile, mal kindlich-naive, aber nie vulgare Witz verbindet historische Referenzen mit burlesker Situationskomik.</desc>

<desc>Die Koloratursopranistin Sabine Devieilhe will Oper allen zuganglich machen Die Opernsangerin Sabine Devieilhe ist vom 28. Februar bis 27. Marz in der Pariser Opera Bastille in Claude Debussys "Pelleas et Melisande" in einer Inszenierung von Wajdi Mouawad zu sehen; und im Februar ist eine Aufnahme von Strawinskys "Die Nachtigall" mit Devieilhe in der Titelrolle erschienen. Die aus der Normandie stammende Sangerin nahm zunachst Cello-Unterricht, bevor sie am Conservatoire national superieur de musique de Paris Gesang studierte. Dabei entdeckte sie ihre Stimmlage als Koloratursopranistin: "Es ist eine sehr hohe und sehr bewegliche Stimme." Sabine Devieilhe vergleicht ihren Beruf mit dem einer Hochleistungssportlerin: "Man muss unter anderem auch an der Rumpfstabilisierung und Beweglichkeit arbeiten, insbesondere als Koloratursopranistin." Geopolitisches Chaos durch Donald Trump: Ist China der groSSe Gewinner? China hat die Einfuhrung neuer Steuern auf amerikanische Agrarprodukte ab dem 10. Marz angekundigt und reagierte damit auf die von Donald Trump angeordnete Erhohung der Zolle auf chinesische Produkte um zunachst 10 %, die am 3. Marz dann nochmal auf 20 % erhoht wurden. Die chinesische VergeltungsmaSSnahme ist die erste seit dem Amtsantritt des Republikaners im WeiSSen Haus, der eine Neuausrichtung der gegenwartigen Weltordnung ausgelost hat. "Die chinesische Diplomatie wird auch weiterhin fest auf der richtigen Seite stehen. Wir werden in dieser unsicheren Welt fur Sicherheit sorgen", versicherte AuSSenminister Wang Yi. Eine klare Botschaft an die Vereinigten Staaten, deren Annaherung an Russland von vielen Beobachtern als Strategie zur Schwachung des Reichs der Mitte analysiert wird. Zum Abschluss der Sendung erzahlt Xavier Mauduit die Geschichte des Teppichs von Bayeux anlasslich der Entdeckung eines Fragments in Deutschland, das vor uber 80 Jahren von einem Nazi-Archaologen in Frankreich geraubt wurde; und Marjorie Adelson berichtet uber die Entscheidung von Amazon, Filme und Serien auf seiner Streaming-Plattform Prime Video mit KI zu synchronisieren, eine schlechte Nachricht fur die Berufe der Synchronisierung.</desc>

<sub-title>Auvergne: Die Geheimnisse der schlafenden Riesen</sub-title>
<desc>Idyllisch und friedlich - so scheint das Leben in der Auvergne. Seit etwa 10.000 Jahren sind hier die Vulkane erloschen, doch in ihnen schlummern noch immer Geheimnisse. Diesen will Arnaud Guerin zusammen mit dem Vulkanforscher Pierre Boivin auf den Grund gehen. Zuerst geht es die Luft: An Bord eines HeiSSluftballons fliegen sie uber die prachtige Vulkankette Cha√Æne des Puys. Vor 8.600 Jahren brach hier zum letzten Mal ein Vulkan aus - doch vielleicht brodelt es hier inzwischen wieder: Kurzlich wurden bedeutende Magmavorrate in der Tiefe entdeckt, die einen erneuten Ausbruch denkbar machen. Die nachste Station auf der Reise fuhrt Arnaud in das Bergmassiv Monts Dore, in dem sich ein sagenumwobener Kratersee befindet: der Lac Pavin. Aufgrund seiner vulkanischen Aktivitaten galt er fruher als verflucht. Von der Luft ubers Wasser geht es nun unter die Erde: Arnaud und Pierre lassen sich uber 25 Meter in die Tiefe der Grotte Creux de Soucy abseilen. Dort unten konnen sie die vulkanische Geschichte der Umgebung nachzeichnen. Pierre ist sich sicher, es wird einen neuen Ausbruch geben, die Frage ist nur wann. Auch heute schon birgt das erloschene Vulkangebiet Risiken: Arnaud wagt sich in die Grotte du Chien, in der eine hohe Kohlendioxidkonzentration herrscht. Auf Kopfhohe besteht keine Gefahr, doch am Boden wurde man bereits nach einer Viertelstunde ersticken. Weniger gefahrlich, dafur umso schoner ist die Felskirche Saint-Michel dAiguilhe, die auf einem Vulkanschlot in 90 Meter Hohe thront. Die Idylle der Auvergne lasst vergessen, dass die Feuerriesen nur schlafen - jederzeit konnten sie wieder erwachen.</desc>

<desc>Ende der 50er Jahre entstand in Frankreich eine neue Stilrichtung im Kino, die sich gegen eine konventionelle Bildsprache und Dramaturgie wandte. Zur Nouvelle Vague gehorten Regisseure wie Fran√ßois Truffaut, Alain Resnais, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol und andere - heute weltberuhmte - franzosische Filmemacher. Das Abenteuer Nouvelle Vague hat auch nach 60 Jahren nichts an Faszination eingebuSSt. Die Dokumentation setzt sich mit dieser avantgardistischen Bewegung der franzosischen Filmgeschichte auseinander: Die jungen AuSSenseiter stellten die bisherige Filmsprache auf den Kopf und pragten so maSSgeblich das moderne Kino.</desc>

<title>Frank Sinatra - Amerikas goldenes Zeitalter</title>
<desc>Frank Sinatra wird am 12. Dezember 1915 als Francis Albert Sinatra in Hoboken, New Jersey, geboren: ein Italo-Amerikaner aus bescheidenen Verhaltnissen, der bald zusehen muss, wie man Geld verdient und dies versucht mit etwas, was er kann und liebt: Singen. In den 1930er Jahren tritt er in kleinen Clubs auf, ist Mitglied verschiedener Bands und Orchester und wagt schlieSSlich 1942 den Schritt in die Solokarriere. Von da an geht es mit der Popularitat nach ganz oben. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren erreicht seine Karriere ihren Hohepunkt. Die USA erleben damals einen spektakularen Aufschwung und das Showbusiness explodiert formlich. Es zeigt eine Welt voller Glamour und Luxus, die das internationale Publikum fasziniert. Zu Sinatras bekanntesten Liedern zahlen "My Way" (1968), "New York, New York" (1979) und "Fly Me to the Moon" (Cover-Version 1964). Seine markante Stimme bringt ihm den Spitznamen "The Voice" ein. Nicht nur als Sanger, sondern auch auf der Leinwand erlangt Sinatra Weltruhm. Fur seine Rolle in "Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit" erhalt er 1954 einen Oscar. Die Dokumentation wirft einen Blick auf das "goldene Zeitalter" der USA und den gleichzeitigen kometenhaften Aufstieg Sinatras mit all seinen Licht- und Schattenseiten. Von New York und Los Angeles uber Palm Springs bis zum Lake Tahoe folgt sie den Spuren eines Ausnahmekunstlers, der den amerikanischen Traum verkorperte. Aus zahlreichen Archivaufnahmen, alten Plattencovern und Plakaten sowie Musik- und Filmausschnitten entsteht ein lebendiges Portrat des Entertainers, dessen Charme unter anderen Ava Gardner, Lauren Bacall und Mia Farrow verfielen. Auch Sinatras Freundschaft zu John F. Kennedy wird thematisiert, die durch die angeblichen Verbindungen des Crooners zur Mafia uberschattet wurde. Und naturlich die Arbeit mit groSSen Regisseuren wie Otto Preminger, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Vincente Minnelli, Frank Capra oder Stanley Kramer, denen der Star einen GroSSteil seiner Filmografie verdankt.</desc>

<title>Yabusame, Japans Samurai-Ladys</title>
<desc>Ayuko Kamimura gehort zu den besten Yabusame-Schutzen der Welt. Seit ihr Vater vor 22 Jahren Yabusame als Sport neu erfunden hat, ist die 51-Jahrige dabei. Ayuko, von allen Amy genannt, ist die erste und bislang einzige Frau, die selbst von den erzkonservativen mannlichen Bewahrern der religiosen Yabusame-Zeremonien als Lehrmeisterin anerkannt wird. Ihr Bogen ist knapp zwei Meter lang. Nirgendwo sonst auf der Welt nutzen berittene Schutzen so lange Bogen. Einmal im Jahr organisiert sie das Sakura-Turnier, das einzige reine Frauen-Event im Yabusame-Sport. In diesem Jahr will sie dort zum letzten Mal vor groSSem Publikum auftreten, bevor sie den Platz fur talentierte Amazonen der jungen Generation raumt. Die Regeln fur den Wettkampf sind genau vorgeschrieben: Fur eine 100 Meter lange Strecke darf Amy maximal zwolf Sekunden brauchen. Drei Mal muss sie dabei auf eine Scheibe schieSSen. Treffer, Zeit und Eleganz entscheiden uber den Sieg. Die Trainingsstunden vor dem Wettkampf sind auch ein Testlauf fur Amys beste Schulerinnen. Die Suche nach einer Nachfolgerin liegt ihr besonders am Herzen. Die 20-jahrige Aoi Fuse hatte das Zeug zu einer Samurai-Meisterin der nachsten Generation. Funf Mal hat sie bereits den Titel in der hochsten Klasse, der Profiliga, gewonnen. Aber behalt sie auch in diesem Jahr die Nerven, wenn es um alles geht? Ausnahmetalent Eri Sakuraba dagegen wird im Fruhling zum ersten Mal in der Profiliga antreten. In den unteren Klassen hat die 14-Jahrige schon als Grundschulerin alle Pokale abgeraumt. Wie aber wird sie bei ihrem ersten groSSen Wettkampf abschneiden? Ganz egal, welche Reiterin am Ende den Preis mit nach Hause nimmt - es wird auf jeden Fall ein groSSer Tag fur die Samurai-Ladys Japans.</desc>

<sub-title>Ein Palast aus Sand: Nepals magische Mandalas</sub-title>
<desc>Im Westen der tibetischen Hauptstadt Kathmandu steht die Thrangu Tara Abbey, ein Kloster, in dem rund 230 Nonnen arbeiten und studieren. Sie gehoren einem der vier groSSen tibetischen Orden an - dem Karma-Kagyu-Orden. Seit 2016 erleben tibetisch-buddhistische Nonnen so etwas wie eine Revolution: Sie gelten als gleichgestellt gegenuber den Monchen - den Mannern des Ordens - und durfen Buddhas Lehre an klostereigenen Universitaten studieren. Wenn das mannliche und das weibliche Prinzip miteinander in volliger Harmonie sind - so der buddhistische Glaube - kann daraus Frieden erwachsen. Viele Nonnen sind Waisen oder stammen aus armlichen Regionen. Im Kloster erhalten sie kostenlos Essen und Bildung - wie Ani Jamyang. Das Kloster ist ihre Heimat geworden. Alle Hingabe der Nonnen gilt aktuell dem Wohl ihres jungst verstorbenen Meisters Thrangu Rinpoche. In allen Klostern des Karma-Kagye-Ordens finden derzeit intensive Gebetszeremonien statt. Sie sollen die Wiedergeburt des Meisters begleiten - die nach Vorstellung der Glaubigen demnachst bevorsteht. Die Nonnen der Thrangu Tara Abbey wollen ihren Teil dazu beitragen und im Tempel ein Schutz-Mandala errichten - aus farbigem Sand. Mit der Fertigstellung residiert Gottin Vajrayogini - so die Vorstellung der Glaubigen - in ihrem Sandmandala-Palast. Nach einer Woche, so sind die Glaubigen uberzeugt, wird sie wieder ausziehen. Danach wird das Mandala rituell zerstort. Diese Sichtweise fasst einen der Kerngedanken des Buddhismus zusammen: Nichts wahrt ewig. Deshalb sollte man fruh lernen, alles woran das Herz hangt, auch wieder loszulassen.</desc>

Menschen entlang der Strecke machen mit ihrer Kultur und den Brauchen vertraut. Zu Ostern lassen sie Drachen steigen und bereiten aus SuSSkartoffeln Conkies zu. Neben den Klangen von Steeldrums ist auch ein beruhmtes Kirchenlied mit St. Kitts verbunden: John Newton beteiligte sich hier am Sklavenhandel und schrieb spater gelautert "Amazing Grace".</desc>

<title>Der Blauling und die neue Wildnis - Das Mangfallgebirge</title>
<desc>Extensiv genutzte Bergregionen bieten im Mangfallgebirge oft letzte Zuflucht fur vom Aussterben bedrohte Tier- und Pflanzenarten. In lichten, beweideten Bergwaldern balzen noch Auerhuhner, seit Jahrhunderten gehegte Feuchtwiesen bieten Ersatz fur entwasserte Moore. Auch fur den Fortbestand der in Bayern vom Aussterben bedrohten Birkhuhner werden im Mangfallgebirge groSSe Anstrengungen unternommen. Sie sollen hier den Platz bekommen, der ihnen im Flachland genommen wurde. Traditionell gemahte und beweidete Almwiesen sind auch Lebensraum fur Insekten, die woanders langst verschwunden sind. Nicht nur das Offenhalten der Walder und der richtigen Mahzeitpunkt auf den Almwiesen sind entscheidend, auch auf die sanfte Beweidung durch Kuhe, Schafe und Ziegen kommt es an. So entstehen eine neue Wildnis und ein Zufluchtsort fur geschutzte Arten. Der Artenschutz wird allerdings mit einer neuen Herausforderung konfrontiert: der langsamen Ruckkehr des Wolfs ins Mangfallgebirge. Wolfe konnen eine Bedrohung fur die Almwiesen sein, doch auch sie sind in Deutschland streng geschutzt. Die Dokumentation begleitet einen in Deutschland stark bedrohten Schmetterling, den Storchschnabel-Blauling, wahrend seines Jahrs auf den Almwiesen. Der Film prasentiert, wie raffiniert die √úberlebensstrategien dieses spezialisierten Tagfalters vom Ei bis zum fertigen Blauling sind. Der Falter reagiert sehr sensibel auf seine Umwelt. Er steht damit beispielhalt fur viele anspruchsvolle und in der Folge selten gewordene Tierarten.

<desc>Mongolen, die Ming- und die Qing-Dynastie, das Britische Empire oder kommunistische Rebellen - China erlebte im Laufe seiner langen Geschichte viele Kriege, Eroberungen und auslandische Invasionen. Doch mit der Grundung der Volksrepublik im Jahr 1949 durch Mao Zedong ging das Land in die Offensive: Annexion und die Kolonisierung von Xinjiang, Eroberung und Unterdruckung Tibets, Koreakrieg, Konflikt mit Indien und Strafexpedition im Vietnam - die Liste ist lang. Als neue politische, wirtschaftliche und militarische GroSSmacht sagt das China Xi Jinpings von sich heute, es fuhre keine Kriege, stehe fur Frieden und halte sich aus den Konflikten anderer heraus.

<title>Moldawien _ Ein Land im Aufbruch</title>
<desc>Vor sechs Jahren hat Nata Albot das "Ia Mania"-Festival zum ersten Mal organisiert. Die sogenannte Ia gehort zum Sonntagsstaat der Moldawierin. WeiSS mit farbiger Stickerei, steht die Bluse fur die kulturelle Tradition Moldawiens. Doch langst geht es auf dem Festival in dem Grenzort Holercani nicht mehr allein um die Bluse. Dort werden Mode, aber auch altes Handwerk und moldawische Kochkunst prasentiert. Nata Albot ist Journalistin, Kochbuch-Autorin, Mutter von drei Kindern, vor allem aber Aktivistin fur ein modernes Moldawien. In ihrem Blog berichtet sie regelmaSSig von den kulturellen Highlights in dem schmalen Land zwischen Rumanien und der Ukraine. Als Zeichen eines Aufbruchs besonders fur ihre vielen Landsleute, die auSSerhalb von Moldawien leben. Auch Nata ist Teilzeit-Emigrantin. Seit einigen Jahren lebt und studiert sie im kanadischen Montreal, doch es zieht die 39-Jahrige regelmaSSig wieder nach Hause. Die Modedesignerin Valentina Vidrascu hat Angebote aus den Metropolen der Welt und bleibt doch in der Heimat. In der Tradition Moldawiens findet sie Inspiration fur ihre modernen Entwurfe. Ekaterina Popescu unterrichtet Frauen der Umgebung im Teppichweben und gibt ihnen so eine Perspektive. Dabei legt sie groSSten Wert auf traditionelle Muster und Farben. Ekaterina und Valentina engagieren sich auch fur das Festival, das im Juli Tausende Besucher in die entlegene Region am Grenzfluss Nister lockt. Mit dabei ist auch die Band Via Daca, deren Texte von der Zerrissenheit zwischen Heimatliebe und Perspektivlosigkeit erzahlen, aber auch von der Hoffnung auf einen Aufbruch.</desc>

<title>Paris, Hauptstadt der Bienen</title>
<desc>In Paris fallt es den fleiSSigen Insekten leicht, Nahrung zu finden, auch dank der uber das ganze Jahr verteilten Blutezeiten. Die abwechslungsreiche Stadtvegetation bietet den Bienen eine Nahrungsvielfalt, die es auf dem Land aufgrund von Monokulturen haufig nicht mehr gibt. Zudem wurde in Paris entschieden, den Gebrauch von Pestiziden ganz einzustellen. Selbst vom Aussterben bedroht, ist die Biene damit zum Symbol des Erhalts der Biodiversitat geworden. Eines der Habitate der Honigbienen von Paris existiert schon seit rund 400 Jahren: der Jardin des Plantes, ein botanischer Garten. Hier finden sich, etwas versteckt, Bienenstocke, die von der Gartnerin Vanessa Voskobo√Ønikoff umsorgt werden. Abseits der √ñffentlichkeit wahnt man sich weit drauSSen auf dem Land, und doch ist man mitten im Herzen von Paris. Ruhe ist fur die Tiere auch in der Stadt wichtig. Die Honigbiene ist ein sogenanntes staatenbildendes Insekt. Sie kann nur in der Gemeinschaft leben. In der Hochsaison zahlt ein Bienenstock etwa 50.000 Bienen und produziert im Schnitt 30 Kilogramm Honig. Um zu wissen, wann es Zeit ist zu ernten, uberprufen die Imker mit Hilfe eines Refraktometers den Feuchtigkeitsgehalt. Auch der Parc de la Villette beheimatet Bienenstocke in einem Schulbauernhof. Hier betreibt der junge Imker Pierre Merlet ein engagiertes Bienenprojekt. Er gewinnt Honig und klart nebenher regelmaSSig interessierte Gruppen uber das Wohl und die Probleme der Honigbienen auf. Pierre hat die aktuellen okologischen Herausforderungen im Blick. Er liebt es, sein Wissen und seine Leidenschaft mit anderen zu teilen.</desc>

<title>Der Dresdner Zwinger - Sachsens Pracht und Prunk</title>
<desc>Dresden, auch "Elbflorenz" genannt, ist eine der schonsten Kunst- und Kulturmetropolen Europas - mit seinem einmaligen Schlosserreigen entlang der Elbe, den funkelnden Schatzen des "Grunen Gewolbes" und der Gemaldegalerie mit der "Sixtinischen Madonna". Sachsens schillernder Herrscher August der Starke wollte aus seiner Residenz eine barocke Perle machen und so seine absolute Macht demonstrieren. Der Pomp von Versailles und die Alluren von Frankreichs Sonnenkonig waren das groSSe Idol dieser Epoche. Der Dresdner Zwinger mit seinen "tanzenden" Sandsteinfassaden und versteckten Wasserspielen ist das Herzstuck barocker Prachtentfaltung in dieser alten Fursten-Residenz: gebaut als steinerne Machtreprasentation Augusts, angelegt als Garten fur kostspielige Orangenbaume und genutzt als Festplatz fur eine Fursten-Hochzeit, die den Anspruch auf den Kaiserthron anmelden sollte. Der Zwinger lasst uns heute in eine Epoche blicken, in der Prunk und Verschwendung zur Reprasentationspflicht eines Fursten gehorten. August der Starke kann seinen Sohn mit einer osterreichischen Kaisertochter verheiraten. Ein unglaublicher Triumph. 1719 feiert der europaische Hochadel deshalb im Zwinger eines der glanzendsten Feste der Barockzeit - mit Reiterspielen, Kostumfest und riesigem Festmahl. Der Zwinger ist der Startschuss fur eine Stadt, die ein Gesamtkunstwerk werden sollte. Die Frauenkirche mit ihrer Kuppel, die majestatische Hofkirche, ein einmaliges Areal imposanter Bauten, das in jedem Jahr Millionen Besucher und Besucherinnen in die Stadt an der Elbe lockt.</desc>

<sub-title>Das Gedachtnis der Pflanzen und Tiere</sub-title>
<desc>Eine neue HeiSSzeit wirft ihre Schatten voraus und verandert unsere √ñkosysteme tiefgreifend. Wie die Zukunft aussehen konnte, erforschen Wissenschaftler an Hitzeperioden der erdgeschichtlichen Vergangenheit. Im Bighorn Basin in Wyoming im Norden der USA ist eine erdgeschichtliche Epoche besonders interessant, denn vor 56 Millionen Jahren erwarmte sich die Erde - vermutlich aufgrund von Vulkanausbruchen - besonders schnell. Nicht so rasant wie heute, aber dennoch eignet sich die Phase des sogenannten Palaozan/Eozan-Temperaturmaximums (PETM) fur Vergleiche mit heutigen Entwicklungen. Fossilien verraten Erstaunliches uber die Tiere, aber auch wie Pflanzen damals reagiert haben. Die Forschenden rekonstruieren, dass sich Vegetationszonen auf der Erde um mehr als 1.000 Kilometer polwarts verschoben haben. Und sie erfahren Beunruhigendes uber die CO2-Speicherkapazitat der Pflanzen. In einem Permafrosttunnel nahe Fairbanks in Alaska reist ein Forschungsteam zuruck in die letzte Eiszeit. Die Untersuchung des Permafrostbodens zeigt, dass in ihm riesige Mengen abgestorbenes Pflanzenmaterial konserviert sind. Taut der Boden, verrottet das Material und der Kohlenstoff geht wieder in die Atmosphare zuruck, als Methan und Kohlendioxid. In Australien entwickelt ein Palaontologenteam gemeinsam mit Artenschutzern eine neue Wissenschaft. Sie wollen aus der Vergangenheit lernen, wie Arten heute und in Zukunft besser geschutzt werden konnen. Mit dieser Strategie wollen sie ein etwa mausgroSSes Beuteltier, das ausschlieSSlich in Australien vorkommt, vor dem Aussterben retten.</desc>

<sub-title>Das Gedachtnis der Meere und Ozeane</sub-title>
<desc>Eine neue HeiSSzeit wirft ihre Schatten voraus und verandert auch die Ozeane tiefgreifend. Wie ihre Zukunft aussehen konnte, erforschen Wissenschaftler an Hitzeperioden der Vergangenheit. An der Universitat Utrecht wird erforscht, was wahrend einer besonders schnellen Erwarmung vor 56 Millionen Jahren in den tropischen Meeren passierte: Sie ahnelten Whirlpools, waren bis zu 38 Grad warm, und nahezu alles Leben verschwand aus ihnen. In Frankreich spuren Palaontologen den Lebensbedingungen urzeitlicher Korallen nach. Sie entdecken: Die Organismen siedeln sich bei steigendenden Temperaturen in kuhleren Breiten an, wachsen dort aber langsamer. Hoffnung bieten auch Refugien wie der Golf von Akaba im Roten Meer. Durch einen erdgeschichtlichen Zufall leben Korallen dort in einem fur sie kuhlen Wasser - sind aber gleichzeitig sehr hitzetolerant. Doch nicht nur warme Meeresgebiete stehen unter Druck. An der Nordwestkuste der USA sorgt die Erderwarmung fur mehr Nordwind, der mehr kaltes, nahrstoffreiches Wasser aus der Tiefe aufsteigen lasst. Die Folge: In den oberen Wasserschichten explodiert das Leben. Doch am Meeresboden zersetzen Bakterien herabsinkende Biomasse und zehren den gesamten Sauerstoff auf. Todeszonen bilden sich. Durch den Meeresspiegelanstieg dringen die Ozeane immer weiter in unseren Lebensraum vor. Geologen der Columbia University in New York rekonstruieren daher aus antarktischen Sedimentkernen und fossilen Korallenriffen, dass der Meeresspiegel in der letzten Warmphase vor 125.000 Jahren bei einem Klima wie heute rund vier Meter angestiegen ist.</desc>

<sub-title>Finden wir den perfekten Geheimcode?</sub-title>
<desc>Dass unsere Daten verschlusselt sind, wenn wir E-Mails abrufen, uns bei unseren Bankkonten anmelden, Nachrichten auf Messenger-Diensten verschicken oder im Internet surfen, verdanken wir der Kryptographie. Im Hintergrund tobt dabei ein Zweikampf: Die Kryptographen entwickeln sichere Geheimcodes, wahrend die Codeknacker versuchen, diese Verschlusselung zu brechen. Es ist ein Katz-und-Maus-Spiel, das sich von der Antike, uber Julius Casar, die Konigshauser im 17. Jahrhundert bis in unsere moderne Welt durchzieht, erklart Cecile Pierrot (Inria Nancy). Je geschickter die Codeknacker agieren, desto ausgefeilter mussen die Verschlusselungsverfahren werden. Unsere Daten heute sind dadurch gesichert, dass niemand die Verfahren knacken kann, die sie schutzen. Zumindest noch nicht. Denn das Spiel konnte eine neue Wendung bekommen: Derzeit werden Quantencomputer entwickelt, die so ganz anders ticken als bisherige Rechner. Sollten sie eines Tages gut funktionieren, konnten sie unsere jetzige Verschlusselung im Handumdrehen brechen - ein Sicherheitsrisiko fur uns personlich und die globale Gesellschaft. "Ohne Kryptographie ware unsere heutige Welt nicht vorstellbar", sagt Peter Schwabe vom Max-Planck-Institut fur Sicherheit und Privatsphare. Zusammen mit dem Mathematiker Eike Kiltz (Ruhr-Universitat Bochum) entwickelt er neue Kryptographie-Verfahren.

Wie seine Hauptfigur im Roman "Der Spieler" fordert auch der russische Schriftsteller Dostojewski sein Schicksal immer wieder heraus. Beim Roulette, wie auch im Leben. Bei der Niederschrift des Romans "Der Spieler" setzt er seine Existenz aufs Spiel. Liefert er nicht fristgerecht, wird er die Rechte an seinem gesamten Werk verlieren.

<desc>Shiori Ito erschuttert die japanische Gesellschaft als Symbol von #MeToo Die Japanerin Shiori Ito lebt heute als freie Journalistin im Vereinigten Konigreich. Ihr jungster Dokumentarfilm "Black Box Diaries" erzahlt ihre eigene Geschichte, mit der sie zum Symbol der japanischen #MeToo-Bewegung (#WeToo) wurde. Im Jahr 2015 traf die damals 25-jahrige Journalistin einen der fuhrenden Moderatoren des japanischen Fernsehsenders TBS und engen Vertrauten des damaligen Premierministers Shinz≈ç Abe, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, weil sie gerne bei TBS arbeiten wollte. Wahrend eines Abendessens in einem Restaurant betaubte der Moderator die junge Journalistin, brachte sie in ein Hotel in Tokio und vergewaltigte sie. Als Shiori Ito Anzeige erstattete, machte ihr die Polizei klar, dass die Beweise nicht ausreichten. Noriyuki Yamaguchi wurde von der japanischen Justiz angeklagt, seine Verhaftung wurde jedoch im letzten Moment auf Antrag eines engen Mitarbeiters von Shinz≈ç Abe aufgehoben. Black Box Diaries wurde 2025 fur den Oscar als "bester Dokumentarfilm" nominiert. Nach Angaben der Journalistin handelt es sich nicht um einen Film uber Vergewaltigung, sondern "uber all das, was danach in der Gesellschaft geschieht, womit die √úberlebende konfrontiert wird", bekraftigt sie. Militarausgaben: Muss Frankreich "zwischen Kanonen und Renten" wahlen? Wahrend die Europaische Kommission einen Plan zur "Wiederbewaffnung Europas" in Hohe von 800 Milliarden Euro vorgeschlagen hat, hat Frankreich angekundigt, seinen Verteidigungshaushalt von 50,5 Milliarden Euro im Jahr 2025 verdoppeln zu wollen. In einem Interview mit der Zeitung La Tribune Dimanche gab der franzosische Verteidigungsminister Sebastien Lecornu an, bis 2030 ein Budget von "etwa 100 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr" erreichen zu wollen, was "fur die franzosischen Streitkrafte das ideale Gewicht" darstellen wurde. Angesichts des groSSen Haushaltsdefizits Frankreichs stellt sich jedoch die Frage, woher die zusatzlichen 50 Milliarden Euro kommen sollen. Die erste Moglichkeit ware, auf die Ersparnisse der Franzosen zuruckzugreifen. Die Bevolkerung konnte ihre Ersparnisse auf freiwilliger Basis in Fonds investieren, mit denen die Verteidigung finanziert wurde. Die zweite Moglichkeit ware, den Haushalt fur Sozialausgaben zu kurzen. Die Gewerkschaften, die gerade uber die Rentenreform verhandeln, lehnen diese Option allerdings ab. Zum Abschluss der Sendung erzahlt Xavier Mauduit anlasslich der Verabschiedung eines Gesetzes, das die Niederlassung von Bistrots in kleinen Gemeinden erleichtern soll, die Geschichte dieses Symbols der franzosischen Lebensart; und Marie Bonnisseau berichtet uber den Kreuzzug Donald Trumps gegen Diversitat, nachdem er das Verteidigungsministerium zur Loschung entsprechender Fotos aufgefordert hatte.</desc>

<desc>Himmelspforte, Nabel der Welt, Quelle allen Lebens und Ursprung der Schopfung - diese Begriffe pragten die imaginare und bildliche Darstellung des Jerusalemer Tempels. Nach der biblischen Legende wurde er von Konig Salomo erbaut, um die Bundeslade und die Gesetzestafeln sicher zu verwahren. Die Klagemauer ist ein Rest der westlichen Umfassungsmauer des Tempels. Zur religiosen Statte des Judentums wurde sie erst nach dem Sechstagekrieg - insbesondere mit der Schaffung eines offenen Zugangs zur Mauer durch den Abriss des Maghrebinerviertels in der Jerusalemer Altstadt. Auf den ersten Blick hat das Bauwerk nur eine Bedeutung: Es steht fur die Abwesenheit eines anderen Bauwerks. Die Abwesenheit des Jerusalemer Tempels. Und doch hat die Mauer mehrere Bedeutungen. Und auch mehrere Namen: In der christlichen Tradition ist es die Klagemauer, an der Juden seit 2.000 Jahren die Zerstorung des Tempels beklagen. Fur Juden aus Jerusalem oder der Diaspora ist es schlichtweg die Westmauer. Das heiSSt, die Mauer, die westlich der einstigen Tempelanlage von Jerusalem stand und bis heute steht. Und fur die Muslime ist es Hait al-Buraq, die Al-Buraq-Mauer. Der Name leitet sich vom Namen des geflugelten Reittiers ab, einer Art mythischer Pegasusfigur aus dem Koran, mit dem Mohammed von Mekka bis nach Jerusalem gereist sein soll, um dort die Propheten zu treffen. Es ist also ein Bauwerk mit drei Namen und folglich auch mit drei Geschichten.</desc>

<sub-title>Was macht uns depressiv?</sub-title>
<desc>Dass Depressionen allein ein chemisches Ungleichgewicht im Gehirn sind, wurde mittlerweile in einer groSSen Studie widerlegt. "Es reicht nicht, um Depressionen zu erklaren, es konnte nur ein Teil des Puzzles sein", sagt Camilla Nord, Neurowissenschaftlerin an der Universitat Cambridge. Aber was ist es dann? Sie und andere Forschende versuchen weiterhin zu verstehen, was in Gehirn und Korper von depressiven Menschen vor sich geht. Dabei untersuchen sie, welche Rolle Entzundungen, Gene oder Bakterien im Darm spielen. Eine vielversprechende Fahrte fuhrt zur Neuroplastizitat. Das ist die Fahigkeit des Gehirns, sich standig zu verandern. Bei Depressiven konnte diese verkummert sein. Mithilfe von Psychotherapie, aber auch Antidepressiva oder neuen Wirkstoffen wie Ketamin oder Psilocybin, kann man sie anscheinend wieder ankurbeln. Andrea Jungaberle leitet eine Klinik in Berlin, die Behandlungen mit Ketamin anbietet. "Man macht mit Ketamin ein neuroplastisches Fenster auf", erklart die Psychotherapeutin, "auch in den Tagen und Wochen nach den Infusionen oder der nasalen Gabe sind die Patienten deutlich ansprechbarer fur neue Lernerfahrungen." Doch die Behandlung mit Ketamin ist nur eine von vielen Therapiemoglichkeiten, die es fur Erkrankte gibt.</desc>

Sarah Missiaen leitet die hochstgelegene Surfschule Europas am Silvaplanersee in der Schweiz. Ihr Geschaftsgluck ist eng mit dem thermischen Malojawind verknupft. Die Forscherin Elke Ludewig hingegen besuchte mit sieben Jahren zum ersten Mal das Sonnblick-Observatorium in Salzburg und beschloss, Atmospharenwissenschaftlerin zu werden. Heute steht sie dem dort angesiedelten Europaischen Zentrum fur Wolkenforschung vor. Die Dokumentation zeigt, welche spektakularen Wetterphanomene die Alpen bieten und wie sie entstehen, welche Rolle das Gebirge fur Wetter und Klima in ganz Europa spielt und auch, wie dort dem Klimawandel begegnet werden konnte. Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler aus Deutschland, Frankreich, der Schweiz, √ñsterreich und Italien geben Einblicke in ihre Projekte. Vorgestellt wird der gesamte Alpenbogen, vom hochsten Punkt am Mont Blanc bis zu den ostlichen Auslaufern bei Wien.</desc>

<sub-title>Sind wir bereit fur eine Weltregierung?</sub-title>
<desc>Mit dem russischen Angriffskrieg auf die Ukraine geriet die Weltordnung des 21. Jahrhunderts ins Wanken. Die Vereinten Nationen, eigentlich als Schiedsrichter fur globale Krisen gedacht, wirkten hilflos. "Die UNO wurde fur die Krisen von gestern gebaut", urteilt Ursula Schroder, Friedensforscherin an der Universitat Hamburg. Doch was braucht es, um Herausforderungen wie Grenzkonflikte oder den Kampf gegen den Klimawandel zu bewaltigen? "Etwas, das einer Weltregierung nahe kommt", sagt Anthony Lang, Professor fur Politikwissenschaft an der University of St. Andrews. Gleichzeitig warnt Lang vor der Gefahr, dass eine solche Regierung zu viel Macht in den Handen weniger konzentrieren konnte. Was konnte unsere heute so zerstrittene Welt dazu bringen, sich unter einer gemeinsamen Regierung zu vereinen? In der Science-Fiction-Welt von "Star Trek" entstand die Weltregierung der Erde nach dem Dritten Weltkrieg. "Die Menschheit lernt offensichtlich in allererster Linie durch Crashs und Katastrophen", meint der Philosoph Richard David Precht. Kann die Menschheit auch ohne Katastrophen zusammenwachsen? Die Zukunftsforscherin Florence Gaub erinnert daran, dass die Weltgemeinschaft erst mit der Einfuhrung global gultiger Zeitzonen entstand. Damals zwangen technische Errungenschaften wie die Telegraphie die Welt zu einem gemeinsamen Konsens. Konnte der technologische Fortschritt also auch heute der Schlussel sein, um unsere Welt naher zusammenzubringen - vielleicht eines Tages sogar unter einer gemeinsamen Regierung?</desc>

<title>Tempel der Hochkultur - Wie Kulturbauten Stadte aufwerten</title>
<sub-title>Signature Building und Selfie-Effekt</sub-title>
<desc>Was haben eine verspiegelte Salatschussel, ein gestrandetes Walskelett und ein riesiges Auge gemeinsam? Sie alle stehen fur auSSergewohnliche, fantasievolle Architektur, die maSSgeblich dazu beigetragen hat, ihre Standorte aufzuwerten. So zum Beispiel das Depot des Museums Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Es entsteht immer etwas Besonderes, wenn das Architekturburo MVRDV ins Spiel kommt: Winy Maas und sein Team sind weltweit bekannt fur ihren mutigen und einfallsreichen Stil. Sie packten das voluminose Kunstlager des Museums kurzerhand in einen ovalen Baukorper mit verspiegelter Fassade. Wie ein Fruhstucks-Ei ist er oben abgeschnitten, um Platz zu schaffen fur einen Dachgarten. Durch die Reflektion der Umgebung wirkt das Gebaude selbst weniger massig. Der begrunte Dachbereich fungiert als Fortsetzung des umgebenden Parks. Rotterdam - nicht arm an innovativer Architektur - hat mit dem Depot ein neues bauliches Glanzstuck hinzugewonnen. Das Prinzip Signature Building setzen viele Stadteplaner inzwischen bewusst ein. Immer mehr Stadte tendieren jedoch dazu, mit Kulturbauten gleich ganze urbane Landschaften zu gestalten. Diese Cultural Cluster umfassen meist mehrere Institutionen wie Museen, Konzerthallen, Performing Arts Center auf engstem Raum. In Spanien entschloss sich die Stadt Valencia in den Boom-Jahren der 90er gleich eine ganze "Stadt der Kunste und Wissenschaften" zu bauen. Die spanischen Stararchitekten Francisco Calatrava und Felix Candela setzten funf futuristische Kulturbauten in eine parkartige Landschaft und schufen so eine eigene Welt.</desc>

<title>Twist</title>
<desc>Sechs bis sieben Jahre unseres Lebens verbringen wir traumend. Ein Drittel unsererZeit erleben wir im Schlaf. Hinzu kommen unzahlige Tagtraume. Luzides Traumen, der Klartraum, liegt im Trend und nirgendwo begegnen uns Gefuhle so ungefiltert und heftig wie im Traum. Doch im Alltag werden Traume oft zur Seite geschoben. Verdrangt, belachelt, vergessen. Anders in der Kunst: Warum traumen wir, und was macht das nachtliche Kopfkino mit uns? In Lyon stellt die Pariser Kunstlerin Justine Emard Skulpturen aus. Sie sind entstanden aus Gehirnaktivitats-Daten von Astronauten beim Schlafen im Weltall. Auch sie selbst begibt sich ins Schlaflabor und will den fluchtigen Traum fassen. Die Wiener Schlafperformerin Anne Glassner legt sich mitten im Trubel der GroSSstadt zum Schlafen und Traumen nieder. Ihre offentlichen Nap-Performances sind fur viele eine Provokation. Und was passiert, wenn Albtraume unsere Nacht beherrschen? Black Metal-Musiker Stephan Kramer nutzt die starken Bildwelten des Albtraums und verwandelt sie. Kreativitat freisetzen, das kann Rinus van de Velde vor allem durch seine gezielten Tagtraume. Er ist ein spannender zeitgenossischer Kunstler und Filmemacher aus Belgien. "Twist" besucht ihn in seinem Filmstudio in Antwerpen, wo er in Filmen und Zeichnungen die Grenze zwischen Realitat und Fiktion verwischt. Van de Velde macht Traume zu groSSer Kunst.</desc>

<title>Die Farben Chinas</title>
<sub-title>Rot - Vom Neujahrsfest und dem Feuer des Sudens</sub-title>
<desc>"Kreislauf der funf Elemente" - so wird eine chinesische Lehre genannt, die den Kreislauf der Natur und des Lebens beschreibt. Darin gibt es funf Phasen, jede davon ist mit einer Farbe verbunden. Grun ist das Holz-Element, was fur den Neubeginn nach dem Winter steht. Das Feuer-Element ist Rot, es steht fur die Hitze, den Sommer, die dynamische Kraft der Jugend und Feierlichkeiten. Einst wurde alles rot geschmuckt, wenn der Kaiser eine Opferzeremonie abhielt. Rot wie das Blut. Heute ist Rot zur Farbe der Freude und des Glucks geworden. Bei Familie Cheng in der historischen Kleinstad Pingyao laufen die Vorbereitungen fur das Neujahrsfest mit Hochdruck. Sie verpacken Geldgeschenke in rote Umschlage, hangen im Hof rote Lampions, Girlanden und Spruchbander auf, wahrend auf dem Herd Dampfbrotchen garen. Mit etwas roter Deko werden daraus Glucksbrotchen fur die ganze Familie - das neue Jahr kann beginnen. Auch in der chinesischen Kuche haben Farben eine groSSe Bedeutung: Rote Nahrung gilt z.B. als gut fur Herz und Dunndarm. Besonders beliebt sind rote Chilischoten. China stellt die Halfte der Weltproduktion an Chili her. Die Schoten trocknen in kilometerlagen Reihen in der Wuste am FuSSe des Tianshan Gebirges. Oft fahren Koche und Kochinnen mit Kleinlastern direkt zu den Trockenfelder, um sich sackeweise Chilis aufzuladen Durch die Lehre der funf Elemente hat die Bedeutung der Farben in nahezu alle Lebensbereiche in China Einzug gehalten.</desc>

<sub-title>WeiSS - Von Tianzhus Schneebergen in die Wuste Gobi</sub-title>
<desc>Jedes Jahr wenn die Kraniche kommen, nimmt sich der Maler Hu Zetao eine Auszeit und zieht sich in das Flussdelta des Shuangtaizi zuruck. Die schwarz-weiSSen Mandschurenkraniche gehoren zu den wichtigsten Vogeln in der chinesischen Mythologie - sie symbolisieren Bestandigkeit und ein langes Leben. "Auf einem Kranich ins Paradies des Westens fliegen, sagen wir, wenn wir das Sterben und die Unsterblichkeit meinen." erklart der Maler. In der uralten Philosophie des Wu Xing, dem Kreis der funf Elemente, gehoren die untergehende Sonne, der Westen, die Ernte und die Farbe WeiSS zusammen. Auch mit der Zeit der Trauer ist die Farbe verbunden. Ein Grund dafur, warum WeiSS fur traditionell denkende Chinesen und Chinesinnen auch nicht auf eine Hochzeit, sondern eher auf eine Beerdigung gehort. Das Element der Farbe WeiSS ist das Metall. Feng Shaoxing ist einer der renommiertesten Porzellanmeister des Landes. Er findet, dass das makellose WeiSS von Porzellan auf Menschen eine beruhigende Wirkung hat. Und: die Herstellung seines Porzellans ist untrennbar mit den funf Elementen verbunden: "Die Basis ist Porzellanerde. Sie ist voller Metalloxide. Es wird Wasser zum Formen des Rohlings und fur die Glasur genutzt. Das Feuer des Ofens brennt mit Kiefernholz. Also sind alle funf Elemente vereint: Erde, Metall, Wasser, Holz und Feuer."</desc>

<title>Die Farben Chinas</title>
<sub-title>Schwarz - Vom Feng-Shui Dorf zum Eis des schwarzen Drachenflusses</sub-title>
<desc>Wenige Lander haben so gegensatzliche Wetterextreme vorzuweisen wie China: von Wustenhitze uber tropisch-feuchte Gegenden bis hin zur subarktischen Zone. Hier, in der nordlichsten Region Chinas, liegt Mohe. Direkt am Heilongjiang, dem "Schwarzen Drachenfluss", der Grenze zu Russland. Im Norden Chinas sind die Winter lang: Bis Mai ist der Fluss meist zugefroren und der erste Schnee kommt schon Ende September. Die Himmelsrichtung Norden ist in China mit der Farbe Schwarz verbunden, auch der Winter, die Zeit der Regeneration. Die Natur kann ruhen und Kraft sammeln, bevor der Kreislauf des Lebens erneut beginnt. Veranderung und Wandel sind Grundprinzipien in der uralten Lehre der funf Elemente. Das Element der Farbe Schwarz ist das Wasser, die Grundlage allen Lebens, Symbol ruhiger Beharrlichkeit. Wasser hat in China von jeher einen groSSen Einfluss auf den Stadtebau gehabt, so auch im 900 Jahre alten Dorf Hongcun in der Provinz Anhui. Es wurde nach den Regeln des Feng Shui errichtet, im harmonischen Einklang mit der naturlichen Umgebung. Die Dacher der Hauser sind schwarz gedeckt - ein symbolischer Schutz gegen Feuer. Schwarz und WeiSS liegen eng beieinander in der chinesischen Philosophie: Die Dunkelheit umfangt den Tag. Weich und hart, oben und unten, schwer und leicht: Gegensatze bringen das Leben in Bewegung. Im Yin und Yang Zeichen ist dieser Grundgedanke symbolisiert. In der sanften Kampfkunst Tai Chi sind Ausgewogenheit und Balance von Yin und Yang die Basis aller Bewegungsablaufe.</desc>

<title>Out of Rosenheim</title>
<desc>In einem verlassenen Ort mit einem heruntergekommenen Motel namens Bagdad Cafe lasst sich Jasmin aus Rosenheim nach einem Streit mit ihrem Ehemann vorerst nieder. Die Chefin des Hotels, Brenda, ist eine larmende Farbige, die unter Dauerstress steht, seit ihr Mann sie verlassen hat. Sie begegnet der Deutschen im Lodenkostum zunachst mit unverhohlenem Misstrauen. Nach und nach gewinnt Jasmin die Sympathie und Freundschaft der wenigen Mitbewohner des Hotels: von Brendas halbwuchsigem Sohn, der standig Bach auf dem Klavier spielt, ihrer aufmupfigen Tochter, einer geheimnisvollen Tatowiererin und von Rudi Cox aus Hollywood. Bereits kurz nach ihrer Ankunft beginnt Jasmin, das abgewirtschaftete Motel aufzumobeln. Mit Charme, Herzlichkeit und Magie bezaubert sie auch die Gaste und Einwohner der tristen Highway-Station. Der Umsatz steigt, da sich die Zaubershow Jasmins mit Brendas Assistenz unter den Truckern herumspricht. Aus Brenda und Jasmin, die unterschiedlicher kaum sein konnten, sind schlieSSlich Freundinnen geworden. Selbst die fehlende Arbeitslizenz kann den Siegeszug der beiden nur kurzfristig aufhalten. Regisseur Percy Adlon ist es gelungen, seinen Film mit Sprachwitz, Ironie und skurrilem Humor in Szene zu setzen. Ohne moralischen Zeigefinger, aber mit vielen pikanten Details und schrillen szenischen Einfallen, entwickelt sich die Geschichte zu einem ungewohnlichen Pladoyer fur Toleranz zwischen verschiedenen Kulturen.</desc>

<title>Robert Mitchum - Hollywoods Bad Boy</title>
<sub-title>Hollywoods Bad Boy</sub-title>
<desc>Ob als harter Kerl mit lakonischem Macho-Charme oder als kaltblutiger Bosewicht - er spielte gerne die Rolle des Bad Boys, aber sein wahres Wesen war ganz anders: Robert Mitchum war der unkonventionellste Star in Hollywoods goldenem Zeitalter. Er brach samtliche Gesetze dieser ebenso gnadenlosen wie perfekt geregelten Welt und setzte sich uber deren Normen hinweg. 1948 stand er wegen des Besitzes von Marihuana vor Gericht und wurde zu sechs Monaten in einem Arbeitslager verurteilt. Als nach seiner Freilassung die Journalisten fragten, wie es denn gewesen sei, sagte er ganz cool: "Wie in Palm Springs - naturlich ohne den ganzen Aufwand." Palm Springs ist ein beliebtes Feriendomizil von Millionaren. Das Publikum liebte diesen Kerl, der so anders war als die ganzen Verfuhrer, Gentlemen, Capra-Helden und formatierten Stars. Er war einer von ihnen, ein Mann von der StraSSe, der Method Acting fur Quatsch hielt und doch alles spielen konnte, Gutmenschen wie Bosewichte. Das Portrat zeigt, wie der unangepasste Schauspieler, der sich den Regeln Hollywoods nie beugte und gegen Werbekampagnen von Studios oder Agenten sperrte, von 1942 bis 1997 in mehr als 120 Filmen zum Star wurde - und das, obwohl er gerne trank, sich ab und an prugelte und eine gesunde Verachtung fur Dummkopfe sowie sich selbst und seine Rollen an den Tag legte. Bereits mit 30 Jahren hat sich Robert Mitchum seinen Platz in Hollywood neben wohlerzogenen Glamourboys wie Gregory Peck und Kirk Douglas erobert. "Fahr zur Holle, Liebling" (1975), "Ryans Tochter" (1970), "El Dorado" (1966) und "Der langste Tag" (1962) zahlen zu seinen herausragenden Filmen. Anhand von Familienarchiven und den Erinnerungen von Mitchums Sohn Christopher wird deutlich, wie der Hollywoodstar es schaffte, in "Die Nacht des Jagers" (1955) einen der starksten Bosewichte der Filmgeschichte zu spielen, ohne dass dies seiner Karriere schadete, und wie er lastigen Zeitgenossen, Studiobossen, Produzenten, cholerischen Regisseuren und sogar dem machtigen Komitee fur unamerikanische Umtriebe die Stirn bot. In den Zeiten eines an Hysterie grenzenden Kalten Krieges muss er vor diesem Komitee den Beweis liefern, ein guter Amerikaner zu sein, vorzugsweise durch die Denunzierung kommunistischer Kollegen. Mitchum verweigert die Aussage. Seine Begrundung: Er rede nicht mit Menschen, mit denen er nicht auch einen trinken gehen wurde.</desc>

<title>Von Cimabue bis Giotto - Die ersten Meistermaler Italiens</title>
<desc>Anlasslich der Wiederentdeckung eines 750 Jahre alten Gemaldes, das zum Rekordpreis von 24 Millionen Euro versteigert und kurzlich in die Sammlung des Louvre aufgenommen wurde, begibt sich die Dokumentation auf die Spuren des in Vergessenheit geratenen toskanischen Malers Cimabue (etwa 1240-1301). Der Wegbereiter fur die westliche Malerei wird in den Lehrbuchern der Kunstgeschichte von seinem Schuler Giotto di Bondone (etwa 1266-1337) in den Schatten gestellt. Dabei war er die Speerspitze einer Generation italienischer Kunstler, die im spaten 13. Jahrhundert, als ihr Heimatland vom Wirken des Heiligen Franz von Assisi gepragt war, die Malerei von Grund auf revolutionierte. Cimabue und seine Schuler brachen mit der Tradition der byzantinischen Ikonenmalerei und offneten die westliche Malerei dem Naturalismus, indem sie versuchten, den menschlichen Korper mit seinen GefuhlsauSSerungen, aber auch die Natur und die gesamte AuSSenwelt so realistisch wie moglich darzustellen. Damit lauteten Cimabue und seine Schuler eine neue Kunstepoche ein. Sie wirkten in Florenz, Pisa, Siena, Arezzo und Assisi und stieSSen binnen knapp dreiSSig Jahren die italienische Renaissance an, die zwei Jahrhunderte spater mit Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo und Raffael ihre Blutezeit erlebte.</desc>

<sub-title>Michelangeli spielt Ravels Klavierkonzert</sub-title>
<desc>Der Name Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli (1920-1995) ist bis heute untrennbar mit dem Klavierkonzert G-Dur von Maurice Ravel verbunden. Wie Benedetti Michelangeli beispielsweise die Trillerketten so artikuliert, dass die Illusion entsteht, als konne man auf der Klaviatur wie auf einem Streichinstrument von einem Ton zum nachsten hinubergleiten, gilt als einzigartig. Gleichzeitig ist Benedetti Michelangeli ein groSSes Mysterium: Er war fur seine zahlreichen Absagen beruhmt-beruchtigt. Kleinste Unstimmigkeiten am Instrument, eine kleine √Ñnderung des Raumklimas von Probe zu Konzert reichten aus, um eine Auffuhrung platzen zu lassen. Sein Ruf, als einer der groSSten seiner Zunft, ist unbestritten. Pianistenlegende Krystian Zimerman erinnert sich an seinen kunstlerischen Austausch mit Benedetti Michelangeli. Fur Pierre-Laurent Aimard ist der italienische Pianist als Magier der Akustik eine erklarte Inspirationsquelle. Serge Celibidache, der Sohn von Sergiu Celibidache, gewahrt Einblicke in die besondere Kunstlerfreundschaft der beiden Perfektionisten. Wahrend sich Marina Baranova in Bayern auf die Suche nach Benedetti Michelangelis Flugel macht, erinnert sich Cord Garben, sein Produzent, an die nicht immer einfache Zusammenarbeit. Jazzmusiker Stefano Bollani, ein Bewunderer von Benedetti Michelangeli, erklart, wie der Komponist Ravel durch Jazzmusik inspiriert wurde. Das vollstandige Klavierkonzert G-Dur von Maurice Ravel, mit Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli und dem London Symphony Orchestra unter dem Dirigenten Sergiu Celibidache, ist im Internet uber arte.tv auf ARTE Concert abrufbar.</desc>

<desc>Als die geburtigen Leipziger vor 20 Jahren aufs Land zogen, auf der Suche nach einer groSSen und bezahlbaren Wohnung samt Werkstatt, zweifelten sie, ob ein so kleines Dorf nicht zu provinziell fur sie sei. Mit den Jahren haben sie das Landleben aber lieben gelernt. Gemuse, Obst und Fleisch kaufen sie am liebsten auf Markten und bei kleinen Bauern in der Region. Und sie haben, nicht zuletzt durch ihre Begeisterung fur Musik, viele Freunde und Bekannte gefunden. Ulrich Raupach ist in der Porzellanmanufaktur fur die Entwicklung der Formen und fur den Verkauf zustandig. Beim Porzellan wie beim Essen gilt bei ihm: Es kann einfach sein, die Qualitat muss aber stimmen - und es darf gerne eine besondere Note haben. Wenig erstaunlich, dass eines seiner Lieblingsgerichte Getzen ist, ein im Ofen gebackener Pfannkuchenteig mit Blaubeeren und knusprigem Speck. Heike Raupach verantwortet in der heimischen Werkstatt die Herstellung der Porzellanwaren. Wie ihr Mann schatzt sie die einfache Kuche - wenn die Zutaten gut und frisch sind. Aber es darf gerne auch Ungewohnliches auf den Tisch, zum Beispiel Leipziger Allerlei zum 30. Hochzeitstag. Den meisten als weich gekochtes Dosengemuse bekannt, liebt Heike das Gericht so, wie es einst zubereitet wurde: mit frischem, knackigem Gemuse, Spitzmorcheln und frischen Flusskrebsschwanzen. Wenn die Kinder Veronika und Karl ihre Eltern besuchen, helfen sie selbstverstandlich in der Kuche mit - erst recht, wenn zum Hochzeitstag der Eltern viele Hande gefragt sind.</desc>

Er fahrt zu Maria Joao Pires nach Spanien, zu Jean-Rodolphe Kars in ein franzosisches Kloster und zu Stephen Kovacevich nach London. Er lasst sich von der Opernsangerin Ermonela Jaho inspirieren, auf dem Klavier zu singen, und vom Dirigenten Antonio Pappano, die Farben des Orchesters aufs Klavier zu ubertragen. Zum Abschluss besucht er seinen alten Lehrer und Mentor Alfred Brendel. Und selbst der 1943 gestorbene Rachmaninoff ist plotzlich wieder sehr lebendig ... - Eine Koproduktion der PARS Media mit dem Bayerischen Rundfunk, der Sergei-Rachmaninoff-Foundation und dem ORF. In Zusammenarbeit mit Arte, RSI, NRK, SRF, SVT und Naxos Audiovisual. Gefordert vom FFF Bayern und von der Funk Stiftung.</desc>

<title>Bruce Liu - Klavier-Festival Ruhr 2024</title>
<desc>"Alle stellen sich Chopin vor wie einen Melancholiker, mit schlechter Gesundheit, voller Kummer und Heimweh. In Wahrheit war er jedoch ein Partylowe!" - ein Zitat von Bruce Liu, das in diesem Konzert an gleich zwei Werken uberpruft werden kann. Liu wurde 1997 in Paris als Sohn chinesischer Eltern geboren und lebt im kanadischen Montreal. Schon fruh nahm er erfolgreich an Wettbewerben teil, doch der Startschuss fur seine Weltkarriere war der Gewinn des Warschauer Internationalen Chopin-Klavierwettbewerbs 2021. Damit landete er direkt in der Liga von Krystian Zimerman, Martha Argerich oder Daniil Trifonow. Fast durchweg spielt Bruce Liu ohne Pedal und formt dabei jede Nuance, jeden Ton mit filigransten Feinheiten im Anschlag. Kristalline Verzierungen funkeln uber einem kuhlen und soliden Bass-Fundament, dabei formt er jeden Ton mit einer beeindruckenden Leichtigkeit an Perfektion und filigraner Detailverliebtheit. Wahre Begeisterung weckt seine schier unglaubliche Wandlungsfahigkeit - in Klangfarben, Ausdruck und Emotion. Das Programm dieses Konzerts hebt die Vielfalt der Tonsprachen der Komponisten hervor und erzeugt Stimmungswechsel von bestandig bis unbestandig, von lyrisch bis dramatisch. Programm: Joseph Haydn - Sonate Nr. 32 in h-Moll Hob. XVI:32 Frederic Chopin - Sonate Nr. 2 in b-Moll op. 35 Nikolai Kapustin - Variationen op. 41 Ludwig van Beethoven - Sonate Nr. 18 in Es-Dur op. 31/3 "Die Jagd" Sergej Prokofjew - Sonate Nr. 7 in B-Dur op. 83 Zugaben: Erik Satie - Gnossienne Nr. 3 Frederic Chopin - Walzer in Des-Dur op. 64/1 "Minuten-Walzer" Aufzeichnung vom 24.

<title>Der Mann aus Marseille</title>
<desc>Im Marseille der 1930er Jahre tobt ein gnadenloser Bandenkrieg um die Kontrolle der Bordelle und Casinos der Stadt. Roberto Borgo, ein beruchtigter Scharfschutze, steht dabei loyal an der Seite seines Freundes Xavier. Doch die rivalisierenden Gangs schrecken vor nichts zuruck und schaffen es Xavier einen Mord anzuhangen, den er nicht begangen hat. Er wird zu zwanzig Jahren Zwangsarbeit im Fort de Bellegarde an der spanischen Grenze verurteilt. Roberto, getrieben von seiner Freundschaft zu Xavier und seiner Liebe zu Georgia, Xaviers Schwester, versucht alles, um ihn zu retten. Doch seine Befreiungsversuche enden in einer Katastrophe: Roberto wird selbst verurteilt und in dasselbe Straflager wie Xavier geschickt. Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs bekommen die beiden Manner eine unerwartete Chance, sich zu rehabilitieren: Als Minenraumer setzen sie ihr Leben aufs Spiel, um ihre Strafe zu tilgen. An den Stranden der Normandie entscharfen sie Bomben und Minen, wahrend um sie herum viele ihrer Leidensgenossen schwer verletzt werden oder sterben. Wieder in Freiheit wollen sie mit Georgia ein neues Imperium in der Unterwelt von Paris aufbauen. Aber die Zeiten haben sich geandert, und bald mussen die drei erkennen, dass ihre Traume von einem Neubeginn stark bedroht sind. "Der Mann aus Marseille" ist ein fesselnder Gangsterfilm uber bedingungslose Loyalitat, unerschutterliche Liebe und den Kampf gegen die Harte des Schicksals - dramatisch, atmospharisch und mitreiSSend.</desc>

Der Naturforscher, Entdecker, Autor und Filmemacher Paul Rosolie beschaftigt sich seit mehr als 20 Jahren mit dem Amazonasgebiet und seiner vielfaltigen Flora und Fauna. Er konzentriert sich dabei auf die Region Madre de Dios in Peru, durch die der R√≠o Las Piedras flieSSt. Der etwa 850 Kilometer lange Fluss spielt eine zentrale Rolle im okologischen System der Region und ist ein wichtiges Refugium fur bedrohte Arten. Mit "Junglekeepers Peru" hat Paul Rosoli eine Organisation ins Leben gerufen die sich fur die Erhaltung der Lebensraume im Urwald einsetzt. Denn auch in Peru ist der Regenwald durch Abholzung, Rodung und illegalen Goldabbau bedroht. In der Dokumentation reist Paul Rosolie an bislang unberuhrte Orte und trifft dabei auf Menschen aus der Region.

<title>Planet Earth III</title>
<sub-title>Fresh Water</sub-title>
<desc>Fresh water is the lifeblood of planet Earth and the stage for extraordinary animal dramas. In the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, a little-known spectacle unfolds above a very special pond. Up to ten thousand gliding tree frogs - the worlds largest known gathering of its kind - descend from the canopy for the most important breeding event of the year. It will only last a day, and with males outnumbering females nine to one, competition is fierce. This is a party you dont want to be late for. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, as the dry season reaches its peak, the last remaining waterhole for miles around becomes a magnet for a different animal: mugger crocodiles. Giants up to five metres long lurk beneath the surface, waiting patiently for thirsty chital deer to approach the waterhole for a drink. But catching their prey is no easy feat and requires them to do something extraordinary. Documented nowhere else, these crafty crocodiles have learned how to exploit their preys need for fresh water - by creating traps. Nestled amongst flowering water lilies, newly hatched "lily-trotter" chicks learn a vital lesson - how to walk on water. Their oversized feet - almost double the length of their body - make for a wobbly start, but their dedicated father will do whatever it takes to keep them safe during the most vulnerable stage of their life. One of the biggest challenges of living in a freshwater world is its dynamic nature. It can appear, vanish or transform rapidly. Survival in these dynamic environments hinges on adaptation. In the Okavango Delta, the arrival of the great annual flood poses a significant challenge for a pack of five African wild dogs. On dry land, they are one of the continents most successful hunters, but as their hunting grounds turn to swamp, they must find an innovative way to master this water world. Meanwhile, millions of goby fish on the remote volcanic island of Bioko prepare for a perilous journey. After months feeding out at sea, they return to fresh water to breed. The safest place to lay their eggs is where ocean predators cant follow - at the very top of a 30m waterfall. Surely an impossible journey for a fish only an inch long, and one that will require a bizarre physical transformation. In a few rare places, like Lake Malawi, fresh water has remained a consistent presence for millions of years, resulting in a dazzling diversity of life. Here, over a thousand unique fish species thrive - more than any other lake on earth, but competition in these crowded waters is intense. To survive here takes ingenuity. Meet Nimbochromis livingstonii - a master of deception that tricks other fish into thinking its dead. Fresh water is vital to life, yet it is a finite resource. Of all the water on earth, only 2.5 per cent is fresh and most of that is locked up as ice or hidden deep below ground. In fact, less than one per cent of fresh water is accessible. Humans rely on fresh water for drinking, agriculture, irrigation, industry and power. Throughout history, we have devised extraordinary means to ensure it is always available for every demand, fostering the dangerous illusion that it is infinitely abundant. Yet today, two-thirds of our worlds great rivers no longer reach the sea, and in the last 50 years, freshwater species have seen an 83 per cent decline globally - a faster decline than that of species in any other habitat. One animal suffering on the front line is the Indus river dolphin in Pakistan. This species is the most endangered freshwater dolphin globally, with only around two thousand individuals remaining. Every year, these dolphins get trapped in the network of irrigation canals which form part of the vast Indus Basin irrigation system - the largest such system on earth. These canals divert water from the Indus River to irrigate crops. As water levels drop due to agricultural demands, the dolphins become stranded in ever-shrinking pools, often hundreds of kilometres away from the main river. Their only hope for survival depends on the efforts of a dedicated rescue team, working to return them back to the river before its too late.</desc>

<desc>Ben Fogle explores and follows the same path that various individuals have walked. Having willingly forsaken the luxuries and lifestyle that the modern world has to offer, Ben Fogle explores the less-than-ordinary life that people have swapped to in the wilderness. Many of these destinations are primarily "off the grid" in some of the most remote locations on earth, including Georgia Swamplands USA, Swedish Arctic Circle, Wilderness Island Australia and the Sahara Desert. Men, either alone or with a family, sacrifice the comforts and almost any social life to experience the hardships, challenges and rewards of a life that is constantly challenged by nature and be at one with nature. Being largely dependant on their own abilities, Ben Fogle experiences their way of living for a week to understand the reasons behind why they chose this new way of living. Released on Channel 5 in the UK, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild was produced by Motion Content Group and Renegade Pictures.</desc>

Last time Ben discovered that, while back-packing, Janey had come across street dogs in need of urgent medical treatment, so she quit her job in the UK and set up a charity in an old, converted school building. Ben got stuck in helping the 25 dogs recovering from operations, joined Janey on rescue missions, and on an outreach project to manage the dog population. He witnessed the team embrace the challenges of working in a country where its people were recovering from their own hardships, but remained steadfast to help. Five years on, Janeys centre looks even more impressive than it did on Bens first visit, with some exciting upgrades. He learns of the struggles Janey has faced since his last visit, how she was left alone during the pandemic, and witnesses the impact her charity is having and find out if her future remains in Sri Lanka.</desc>

<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<title>Donizetti - Don Pasquale</title>
<desc>Frederic Chaslin leads the Orchestre Symphonique Region Centre-Val de Loire/Tours and the Choir of Opera de Tours in a performance of Gaetano Donizettis comic opera Don Pasquale (1842). Featuring a cast of the most famous singers of the day, Don Pasquale premiered at the Parisian Salle Ventadour in 1843. It was an immediate success, being performed in the great opera houses of Europe within a year after its premiere. The works libretto is largely written by Giovanni Ruffini, as well as by the composer himself. It tells the hilarious story of the old, wealthy bachelor Don Pasquale, who is outraged when hearing his nephew Ernesto wishes to marry the impoverished widow Norina. Consequently, Pasquale decides to disinherit his nephew by marrying himself. His friend Malatesta and Norina, however, make up a plan to thwart the old bachelor, arranging a mock marriage. Among the soloists are Laurent Naouri (Don Pasquale), Florian Sempey (Malatesta), Sebastien Droy (Ernesto), Anne-Catherine Gillet (Norina), and Fran√ßois Bazola (notary). This performance was recorded at Opera de Tours, in 2021.</desc>

<title>Purcell - King Arthur</title>
<desc>Herve Niquet conducts the choir and orchestra of Le Concert Spirituel in a rendition of Henry Purcells (1659-1695) King Arthur. The recording took place in the National Opera of Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon in March 2009. Soloists are Ana Marin Labin, Chantal Santon-Jeffery, Melodie Ruvio, Mathias Vidal, Marc Mouillon and Joao Fernandes. King Arthur, or The British Worthy is a semi-opera in five acts. It was first performed at the Queens Theatre, Dorset Garden, London in 1691. The plot is based on the battles between King Arthurs Britons and the Saxons, rather than the legends of Camelot. It is a semi-opera: the principal characters do not sing, except if they are supernatural or pastoral.</desc>

<title>Mahler - Symphony No. 3</title>
<desc>Due to its 95-minute duration, Gustav Mahlers Symphony No. 3 is an imposing and mysterious work. This 1992 performance, directed by Bernhard Haitink, includes the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Tolzer Knabenchor, and the Ernst Senff Choir. During the six parts of this wonderful symphony, Mahler expresses his musical vision of nature and mankinds place in it. Much like he did in his second symphony, Mahler incorporates some of his song cycle Des Knaben Wunderhorn. The fourth movement ends with a magnificent solo for alto, inspired by a poem by Friedrich Nietzsche, played here by Florence Quivar, and the fifth movement concludes with a male choir. The third symphony originally consisted of seven movements, but Mahler eventually chose to cut the seventh part, which he then used as the last movement for his fourth symphony.</desc>

<desc>Renowned French string quartet Quatuor √âb√®ne marked the 250th birth anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) with a remarkable project: recording all of the great composers sixteen string quartets. For five years, violinists Pierre Colombet and Gabriel Le Magadure, violist Marie Chilemme, and cellist Rapha√´l Merlin immersed themselves in Beethovens 650 pages of sheet music.

He has a great passion for chamber music and plays a lot of recitals with the Italian pianist Enrico Pace. The concert closes with Stravinskys The Rite of Spring which he wrote in 1913 for Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes. The premi√®re caused a lot of sensation and near-riot in the audience because of the avant-garde nature, music and choreography of the piece.

<desc>In this six-part documentary on the life and work of Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, director Liloye Boubli takes viewers on a journey through the life and work of this legend of Brazilian classical music. The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887.

<title>Haydn - Symphony No. 45 "Farewell"</title>
<desc>Under the direction of Conrad van Alphen, the Sinfonia Rotterdam Orchestra performs Haydns Symphony No. 45 at the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) in The Hague. This piece is nicknamed "Farewell" because of a funny anecdote. Haydn and his musicians stayed every year from May to October at the magnificent Esterh√°azy Palace, at the request of Prince Nicholas. In early November 1772, the prince announced his intention to remain at the palace for two more months. The musicians then told Kapellmeister Haydn their disagreement with this forced extension of their stay. The solution proposed by Haydn was to compose a piece delivering a clear message: at the end of the last movement of the Symphony, the musicians were called to blow the candles on their lectern and leave the room one after the other. Prince Nicholas understood the message; the next day a car was waiting for the musicians to take them home.</desc>

<title>Wagner - Das Rheingold</title>
<desc>Hartmut Haenchen conducts the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and Dutch National Opera in a production of Richard Wagners opera Das Rheingold, the first opera of the four-part cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Richard Wagner, perhaps the greatest innovator of the opera genre in the nineteenth century, aimed for the creation of a "Gesamtkunstwerk" in which theatre, music and words are united. The opera cycle was composed between 1853 and 1874, and consists of Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, and Gotterdammerung. Noteworthy about Wagners operas is his use of the so-called Leitmotiv, a recurrent melodic motif that stands for a certain idea or character. Moreover, Wagner uses unconventional harmonies and very extensive orchestral instrumentation. The entire cycle is still performed annually at the Bayreuth Festival, where it premiered in 1876. This 2014 performance was recorded at Het Muziektheater Amsterdam under the artistic direction of Pierre Audi. Among the soloists are Thomas Johannes Mayer, Vladimir Baykov, Marcel Reijans, Stefan Margita, and Werner van Mechelen.</desc>

In this performance, Les Dissonances present Johannes Brahmss Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68. Brahms realized he was expected to compose a symphony that would match the musical standards established by Ludwig van Beethoven. After working on it for at least fourteen years, he completed his Symphony No. 1 in 1876. Brahmss symphony was hailed as Beethovens Tenth: a worthy successor to Beethovens Symphony No. 9. Brahmss work contains several references to Beethoven. For instance, the main theme of the fourth movement - first appearing in the strings - resembles the "Ode to Joy" in the finale of Beethovens Symphony No. 9.

Humoreske is one continuous piece consisting of contrasting sections.

In this composition, the violin does not allow itself a break, continually tells its dark story and gets into a vicious circle of ostinato Passacaglia bass lines again and again falls into beguilingly beautiful singing. Tchaikovsky initially thought his "Symphony of Fate" was a failure and believed himself to be at the end of his creative powers. It was probably the composers nature, plagued by self-doubt, that made it almost impossible for him to develop a self-confident attitude to his own creative power. Between this two works, Skride performs Stravinskys Elegy for Solo Violin.</desc>

<desc>Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday tells us the story of one of jazzs greatest singers ever. Although Billie Holiday lived a life filled with tragedy, this documentary focuses more on her achievements as a singer and her exceptional ability to convey emotions through her voice, rather than going into detail about her drug and alcohol addictions and destructive relationships. Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday features several brilliant performances of Billie Holiday.

Basies orchestra was characterized by a light, swinging rhythm section that he led from the piano, lively ensemble work, and generous soloing. Basie was not a composer like Duke Ellington or an important soloist like Benny Goodman. His instrument was his band, which was considered the epitome of swing and deeply influenced jazz.

<sub-title>Chamber Music: Sissoko and Segal</sub-title>
<desc>Hailing from a long tradition of Malian kora players, Ballake Sissoko has worked with renowned musicians such as Toumani Diabate and Taj Mahal. He met the French born Vincent Segal by chance, and the two began jamming together, uncertain of what kind of music might result. As a former member of the French National Orchestra, Segals Western classical training does not prevent him from exploring a wide variety of extended techniques, rendering his cello a flexible partner to Sissokos kora. A childhood spent in the Pigalle district of Paris surrounded by immigrant communities exposed Segal to African music from an early age. As such, he possesses a natural sensitivity to Sissokos West-African style. The concert shows a brilliant interplay between the two musicians and combines the several worlds of jazz, Malian and classical music.</desc>

<desc>The mere mention of the name John Coltrane evokes a deeply emotional, often spiritual response from even the most casual jazz fan. Dexter Gordon was a fantastic saxophonist. Miles Davis was a genius. Coltrane stood above - he was a visionary, a saint-like figure. By the standards of most jazz musicians, his life was uneventful. Sure, he had a heroin habit for a while, and Miles Davis punched him, but once hed experienced the "spiritual awakening" described in the liner notes of his 1965 album A Love Supreme, he dedicated himself to his music with extreme single-mindedness.

<sub-title>M√µrv kirikus</sub-title>
<desc>Aasta 1993, uks Eesti vaikelinn. Kiriku√µpetaja leitakse hommikul kiriku p√µrandalt, tema pea on haamriga sisse loodud ja kaarkambrist on kadunud hoiukarp. Kuritoo motiiv naib selge olevat - roovm√µrv. Uurijad satuvad kohe poliitilise surve alla tapmine kiiresti lahendada. √úsna pea selgub ka v√µimalik kahtlusalune. Ometi tunneb kogenud uurija Karl Kunnap, et see lugu on keerulisem ning roovm√µrv v√µib olla lavastus millegi varjamiseks.</desc>

<desc>Morten on uudishimulik ja leidlik poiss. Saatuse tahtel on ta sunnitud elama koos kasuvanematega, kes ei nae tema loovas tegevuses muud kui pahatahtlikku huligaanitsemist. Emata Morten ei ole siiski orb. Ta isa on kapten kes too t√µttu peab suurema osa ajast merel viibima. Morten soovib isa eeskujul samuti kapten olla ja ehitab endale mangulaeva, mille mehitab erinevate putukatega. Unenaoline paralleelmaailm kirjeldab Morteni elu groteskses v√µtmes. Mingil hetkel maailmad segunevad - nii Morteni paris kui ka fantaasiamaailm ahvardavad kokku kukkuda. M√µlema maailma paastmiseks on vaja julgelt tegutseda. Morteni kindlameelse tegutsemise taga on p√µhim√µte - kapten ei jata kunagi oma laeva. Film on kirjeldust√µlkega.</desc>

Felice (Pierfrancesco Favino) on sundinud ja kasvanud Napolis, aga viimased nelikummend aastat elanud mujal. Oma sunnilinna naastes haarab meest nostalgia, samas tunneb ta end kodukohas v√µ√µrana ja malestustes t√µuseb pinnale ka palju hairivat. Felicele meenub lapsep√µlves√µber Oreste, kellega tal on uhised saladused, minevikuga silmitsi seismine narib hinge... Tundub, et parim, mis Felice teha saab, on Napolist lahkuda. Nostalgia j√µud on aga suur.</desc>

<desc>Len√ßois Maranhensese k√µrb on uks planeedi ebatavalisemaid paiku. Siin ei ole tuupilist liivamaastikku, kopterist on naha, et luited vahelduvad suure hulga jarvedega.

Kummalisel kombel haigestunud kuninganna Anne (Veneetsia festivalil parima naisnaitleja auhinna v√µitnud Olivia Colman) igavleb luksuslikus palees oma voodis. Tema naeruvaarse imetluse on palvinud 17 armsat jankukest ja ta osaleb alati ekstravagantsetel meelelistel uritustel, kuid lukkab olulisemad kohustused oma ustava s√µbranna Sarah (Oscari-v√µitja Rachel Weisz) kaela. Marlborough hertsoginna kutsub palee toateenijaks veetleva, kuid ujeda n√µbu Abigaili (Oscari-v√µitja Emma Stone). Petlikuna naiv kuninglik rahu ja peomeeleolu ei jaa aga kauaks kestma, kui need kolm kuritahtlikku ja kalki naist hakkavad tunnetama armastuse varjatud piire eri moel.</desc>

<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons. Some are following their dreams of a simpler lifestyle.</desc>

<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons. Some are following their dreams of a simpler lifestyle.</desc>

<desc>Join our hosts, Mikey Kay and Garth Baldwin, as they investigate whether the famed and mysterious Knights Templar were really disbanded and destroyed in 1307 or if they survived, taking the Holy Grail with them. The historical detectives journey through the middle-east in an attempt to uncover new evidence of the true fate of this secretive organization. Starting off in the holy city of Jerusalem, the team explore archaic tunnels and a safe house that could have been used to smuggle religious relics to safety. Their exploratory travels then take them to the ancient city of Acre and on to Cypress to search for clues about a covert Templar mission. Secret Templar codes lead the unit to a monastery in Spain which might be able to prove that the knights survived the fateful arrests of Friday the 13th, 1307.</desc>

<desc>This is a documentary film about the build-up, making, release, and - crucially - music contained on this most revered of albums. With the aid of rare and classic performances, scarce interviews, seldom seen photographs and contributions from those involved in the making of the record - plus the review and critique from a panel of Zeppelin experts - this program finally lifts the lid on what many believe to be Led Zeps very finest offering. With contributions from; the albums engineer, Ron Nevison; former Yardbird, Chris Dreja; Swansong recording artist, Maggie Bell; author of The Rough Guide to Led Zeppelin, Nigel Williamson; Tight But Loose editor, Dave Lewis; Classic Rock Magazines Malcolm Dome; renowned guitar tutor and author, Rikky Rooksby and Robert Plant biographer, Neil Daniels. This is the complete story behind what what Rolling Stone called "their Tommy, Beggars Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one".</desc>

<sub-title>Blur</sub-title>
<desc>Blur was formed in the late 1980s when all four members were attending Londons Goldsmiths College. However lead signer Damon Albarn and guitarist Graham Coxon had actually known each other since childhood, growing up together in Colchester. With bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree, the band began playing under the name of Seymour, after a character created by J D Salinger, but they soon changed that to Blur to secure a deal with Food Records. After their debut Shes So High failed to trouble the top of the charts, Blur teamed up with producer Stephen Street. They had immediate success with the single Theres No Other Way. Upon its release, Blurs debut album, Leisure, failed to make the impact Food Records had hoped for but the band had a musical turning point with the release of the single Popscene. It had a distinctly English sound and is often credited as being the very first Britpop song. Blur decided to take on a quintessentially English style and image for their second album, Modern Life is Rubbish. By hanging on to their newfound English heritage, commercial fortunes would change for Blur in 1994 with the release of the single Girls and Boys. The success of Girls and Boys propelled the bands third album, Parklife, to enter the charts at number one.</desc>

<desc>Napsitrallide valve alla jaetakse mootorratas. Aga on utlematagi selge, et kui mootorratas juba Esnas on, siis ei jata Paavel juhust kasutamata ja kohe peab sellega m√µned tiirud tegema. √ïli valab tulle ka Krista, kes Paavlit enam k√µige nooremaks meheks ei pea. Kiriku√µpetaja aga avastab poeriiulitelt enda pildiga raamatu. Vaatamata k√µigi esnalaste kahtlustele, selgub viimaks t√µsiasi, et Viktor Koosaare elulugu on veel kirja panemata. See omakorda vallandab Esnas elulooraamatute kirjutamise laine. Varik aga otsustab teha l√µpu igasugusele ebakainele s√µidulaadile, mis Esna vanad ja noored vallutanud on. K√µige parem on selleks muidugi korraldada koolitus.</desc>

<title>McCoy Tyner Trio live at Estival Lugano</title>
<desc>Since 1977, Estival is a summer jazz festival in Switzerland, Lugano. Estival offers a thrilling and particularly surprising line-up that explores the rich world of contemporary music whilst promoting the understanding of different cultures, tolerance, and co-existence. McCoy Tyners first main exposure came with Benny Golson, being the first pianist in Golsons and Art Farmers Jazztet. Hes also known for his work with the John Coltrane Quartet. Tyners style is easily comparable to Coltranes maximalist style of saxophone. Though a member of Coltranes group, he was never overshadowed by the saxophonist, but complemented and even inspired Coltranes open-minded approach. McCoy Tyner is considered one of the most influential jazz pianists of the 20th century, an honour he earned both with Coltrane and in his years of performing following Coltranes death.</desc>

<title>Glenn Gould - Hereafter</title>
<desc>HEREAFTER is a retrospective of the life and work of Gould, seen from todays point of view. Based a synthesis of all the documents existing on Gould, whether of a musical or of a literary and intellectual nature, this film strives to deal with the question of Goulds genius such as it is perceived by his audience, an audience that extends far beyond the strict notion of a musical audience. It is made with the participation of anonymous "disciples", making it seem as if Gould himself was answering their questions; meanwhile, Gould appears as the master of the narration of the film.

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time?

Iga 11 minutiline osa seondub Michael Bondi originaalraamatutega ja uute Paddingtoni filmide vaimuga, raakides uusi Paddingtoni lugusid huvitavas uues animeeritud vormis. Sari sobib lastele ja taiskasvanutele. Taiskasvanud tunnevad ara Paddingtoni, keda nad teavad ja armastavad ning vaiksed lapsed avastavad ta esimest korda. Sarja m√µjutab Paddingtoni filmid, aga erinevus on selles, et tegelased, eriti Browni perekond, on nooremaks tehtud. Nad alustavad noore perekonnana, mitte mugavate keskealistega, keda v√µib naha filmides.</desc>

<desc>Mental Hen: Kowalski has a rival, if you even can call it a rivalry. A Delaware Blue Hen has taken up residence at the zoo, and she has the amazing ability to predict the future! Kowalski doesnt buy the psychic chicken hype and sets out to discredit her. The truth turns out to be far more sinister than a simple sports-pickin chicken, and Kowalski will have to use all his best moves to wiggle out of this mess. Thumb Drive: The penguins need a thumb, and Maurices fits the bill nicely. Using the opposable digit thumbprint to break into a secret weapons lab gets the penguins all atwitter. King Julien is unhappy that his right hand man is running around on missions with the birds so he sets out to sabotage the mission. As with most of King Juliens plans, this scheme turns out to be "thumbs down"!</desc>

The slippery armadillo needs Privates help to make good on an ill-advised bet with two gopher brothers. Whos the bad guy here though? The gophers show up at the zoo to actually warn the penguins about the kid! The story takes us on more twists and turns than a Pebble Beach golf hole!</desc>

<title>Der Heilige Gral - Wahrheit oder Legende?</title>
<desc>Was wissen wir wirklich uber den Gral? Ist es ein Kelch? Oder eine heilige Schale? Oder das Blut von Christus? Handelt es sich um ein imaginares Objekt aus der Artusliteratur oder gar um eine gottliche Lehre? Entdecken Sie die vielen Theorien, die sich hinter dem Begriff "Heiliger Gral" verbergen, von Spanien bis Italien, uber Frankreich und Jerusalem. Dank der Unterstutzung von Experten, Historikern und Wissenschaftlern stellt dieser beispiellose Dokumentarfilm die Legende der Wissenschaft gegenuber und versucht, dem groSSten Mythos der Menschheit endlich ein Gesicht zu geben. In Valencia, Spanien, befindet sich in einer imposanten Kathedrale ein geheimnisvoller, mit Edelsteinen besetzter goldener Kelch. Dieser unbezahlbare Gegenstand wird als der Heilige Gral angesehen.

<title>Megafestungen - Geniale Bauwerke</title>
<desc>Vauban hat die Geschichte der Militararchitektur so gepragt, dass sein Name ausreicht, um an ein Verteidigungssystem zu erinnern. In Frankreich ziehen drei Jahrhunderte nach ihrem Bau noch 160 Festungen die Grenzen des Landes. Ingenieur, Militararchitekt, Stadtplaner und Essayist - Vaubans Genie wurde oft kopiert, aber nie erreicht. In Lille fuhrte er sein erstes GroSSprojekt durch, das sein Markenzeichen sein sollte: die Sternbefestigungen.</desc>

<title>Reise ins Ungewisse - Wie sicher sind unsere Flughafen?</title>
<desc>Wir kennen es alle: kilometerlange Schlangen an den Sicherheitskontrollen deutscher Flughafen, verzweifelte Urlauber, genervtes Personal. Aber woran liegt das? An zu wenig Fachkraften oder daran, dass der Security-Check von privaten Sicherheitsfirmen durchgefuhrt wird? Politiker und Gewerkschaften fordern die Verstaatlichung der Luftsicherheit. Wie gut das funktionieren kann, zeigt der "Franz-Josef-StrauSS" Flughafen in Munchen. Sicherheitspersonal, angestellt vom Staat, fuhrt hier die Personenkontrollen durch, mithilfe neuer 3D Technik. Berlin Brandenburg setzt auf "die neue Welt", ein Modell, bei dem der Flughafen mitreden darf. Ganz anders lauft es in Tel Aviv - was genau macht den Flughafen zum vermeintlich sichersten der Welt? Eine Dokumentation uber Probleme und Moglichkeiten der Luftsicherheit an deutschen Flughafen.</desc>

<title>Tantsija</title>
<desc>Andeka tantsija Sergei Polunini dokumentaalportree. Polunin oli Londoni Kuningliku Balleti noorim esitantsija, kes ootamatult lavalt lahkus. See tekitas ≈°oki tema austajates ja ka nendes, kes olid nimetanud teda skandaalitsejaks ning klassikalise balleti pahaks poisiks. Polulin siirdus Venemaale. Filmi tegevustik toimub mitmes linnas, kuid tahtsaimad paigad, mille Sergei Polunin vallutas, on Kiievi, Londoni ja Moskva balletilavad.</desc>

<sub-title>Das schutzende Licht / Eine Blume als Zeuge / Todlicher Zauber / Das alte Fahrrad / Der Klavierlehrer</sub-title>
<desc>Das schutzende Licht - Caitlin Woods Mutter hat wunderschone Kerzen hergestellt. Eines Tages wird Caitlins Lieblingskerze entwendet. Bei einem Stadtbummel, den Caitlin unternimmt, wird ihr die Handtasche entrissen. Ungeachtet der Gefahren nimmt sie die Verfolgung des Diebes bis in dessen Wohnung auf. Als der Dieb sie angreift, geschieht Wundersames... Eine Blume als Zeuge - Fur den Mord an einem Blumenhandler gibt es weder Zeugen noch ein Tatmotiv. Deshalb schlagt Detektiv Parkers Partner Dean einen eigenartigen Test vor: Wahrend seines Studiums wohnte er einem Versuch bei, bei dem sein Professor Pflanzen an einen Lugendetektor angeschlossen hat, um zu beweisen, dass Pflanzen auf AuSSenreize reagieren. Da der Blumenhandler in seinem Laden umgebracht wurde, bestunde doch die Moglichkeit, dass die Pflanzen als "Zeugen" in Frage kamen... Todlicher Zauber - Seit vielen Jahren versuchen die Bruder Leonard und Philip Kirby, aus dem Schatten ihres groSSen Vorbildes Houdini zu treten, und selbst groSS herauszukommen. Dafur wagen sie ein einmaliges Experiment: Philip soll sich lebendig begraben lassen, eingefroren in einem massiven Eisblock. 24 Stunden soll die sensationelle Nummer dauern - und 22 Stunden lang verlauft auch alles nach Plan... Das alte Fahrrad - Seit sie ihre Eltern bei einem Verkehrsunfall verloren haben, schlagen sich die Bruder Nick und Kenny mehr schlecht als recht durchs Leben. In einem Geschaft entdecken sie ein altes Fahrrad, das Kenny unbedingt kaufen mochte, um es zu restaurieren. Als sie das Rad untersuchen, entdecken sie einen Zettel, auf dem der Besitzer bittet, das Rad zuruckzugeben. Die beiden staunen nicht schlecht, als sich ihr verstorbener Vater als Besitzer des Rades herausstellt... Der Klavierlehrer - Nathaniel Born galt als musikalisches Wunderkind und ist heute ein weltberuhmter Konzertpianist, der viel von seinem Konnen seinem alten Lehrer Martin Schiller zu verdanken hat. Eines Tages geschieht das Unfassbare: Nathaniel ist wie blockiert und scheint das Klavierspielen uber Nacht vollig verlernt zu haben...</desc>

<sub-title>Das 150 Jahre alte Fachwerk-Gebaude</sub-title>
<desc>Heike (42) und Dieter (45) leben in standigem Streit mit ihrem Vermieter! Schimmel in allen Raumen und ein absturzgefahrdeter Balkon! Das Ehepaar aus Seelscheid in Nordrhein-Westfalen will nur noch raus aus seiner Horror-Wohnung und macht sich auf die Suche nach einem Schnappchenhaus. Und sie werden fundig: Fur 58.900 Euro kaufen Heike und Dieter ein Haus, das sie in Eigenregie wieder in Schuss bringen wollen. 160 Quadratmeter Wohnflache und 470 Quadratmeter Grund. Die Freude ist groSS, denn das 150 Jahre alte Fachwerk-Gebaude liegt nur wenige Meter von ihrer jetzigen Wohnung entfernt. Doch schnell beschleicht die stolzen Eigenheimbesitzer ein ungutes Gefuhl. Grund: Im Haus sind zur einen StraSSenseite hin alle Fenster zugenagelt. Von den Vorbesitzern der Immobilie erfahren Heike und Dieter, dass in dem Wohnblock seit 20 Jahren ein boser Nachbarschaftsstreit tobt! Die ehemaligen Eigentumer haben deshalb die Fenster des Schnappchenhauses verrammelt! Heike und Dieter wollen der Sache auf den Grund gehen und geraten dabei zwischen die Fronten.</desc>

<title>Zuhause im Gluck - Unser Einzug in ein neues Leben</title>
<sub-title>Schone Zimmer fur alle Kinder</sub-title>
<desc>Alexandra und Dirk lernen sich 2003 online kennen. Zwischen den beiden funkt es sofort: bald wird geheiratet, 2006 kommt das erste Kind zur Welt. Ein gemeinsames Zuhause sollte das Gluck perfekt machen. LKW-Fahrer Dirk mochte das Eigenheim selber renovieren und so herrichten, dass man zumindest darin wohnen kann. Fur Alexandra ist gerade das wichtig: Sie leidet an Asthma und einem kollabierten Lungenflugel. Fur die Familie andert 2007 die Geburt der zweiten Tochter alles: Amy kommt drei Monate zu fruh und ist an Trisomie 21 erkrankt. Das Kind hat besondere Bedurfnisse: Amy spricht nicht richtig, muss Windeln tragen und auch das Laufen fallt ihr schwer. Drei Mal wochentlich muss die Forderschulerin zu Ergotherapie, Logopadie und Krankengymnastik. Ein selbststandiges Leben wird auch in Zukunft fur Amy kaum moglich sein. An den vor Jahren begonnenen Umbau ist nicht mehr zu denken. Zwar arbeitet LKW-Fahrer Dirk nach dem Job tapfer weiter an den eigenen vier Wanden, doch das Projekt wachst ihm uber den Kopf. Das "Zuhause im Gluck"-Team ubernimmt: Die Familie braucht behindertengerechte Aufenthaltsmoglichkeiten und einen Ruckzugsbereich. Auch an grundlegenden Dingen mangelt es: nur das Bad hat eine funktionierende Heizung.</desc>

<desc>Julia und Yannick lernen sich auf einer Party kennen. Fur Julia war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick und nach einem gemeinsamen Festivalbesuch stand fur beide fest, dass sie zusammengehoren. Es dauert nicht lange und Yannick zieht bei Julia und ihrer Tochter Leticia ein. Julia macht von Anfang an kein Geheimnis um ihre Krankheit: Julia leidet an dem Gendefekt HMSN Typ 1, eine Nervenkrankheit, die durch Muskelschwund gekennzeichnet ist. Yannick will fur seine kleine Familie sorgen und so geben Julia und Yannick sich im Februar 2015 das Ja-Wort und kaufen ein Haus, um sich dort eine gemeinsame Zukunft aufzubauen. Yannick beginnt das Haus zu renovieren, auch um den Bedurfnissen von Julia gerecht zu werden und ihr einen Ruckzugsort zu schaffen. Das Schlafzimmer und Wohnzimmer im Erdgeschoss kann er noch fertigstellen, bevor 2015 das Schicksal bei der jungen Familie zuschlagt: Yannick hat auf dem Heimweg einen schweren Autounfall, weil er am Steuer einschlaft. Die √Ñrzte stellen die Diagnose: Narkolepsie. Bei dieser neurologischen Erkrankung leiden die Patienten unter Einschlafattacken. Die Diagnose ist ein schwerer Schlag fur die ganze Familie, denn seither ist Yannick arbeitsunfahig. Der junge Mann ist am Ende seiner Krafte und muss sich von der Vorstellung losen das Haus in Eigenleistung fur seine Familie umbauen zu konnen. Dabei braucht die junge Familie den Platz mehr denn je, denn im Oktober 2015 kommt Yannicks und Julias gemeinsame Tochter Lilith zur Welt. Derzeit spielt sich das Leben der vierkopfigen Familie nur im Erdgeschoss ab, da sich die obere Etage, auf der die zukunftigen Kinderzimmer liegen, im Rohbau befindet. Weder Yannick noch Julia haben einen Raum, in den sie sich zuruckziehen oder sich ausruhen konnen. Auch Leticia, die bereits in die Schule geht, hat kein eigenes Zimmer, die Schularbeiten macht sie am Kuchentisch, Freunde einladen kann sie nicht. Die gesamte Familie braucht dringend Raum, um zur Ruhe zu kommen. Das "Zuhause im Gluck"-Team reist an, um der Familie zu helfen.</desc>

Weil Blut dicker ist als Wasser, treffen sich die Krefts regelmaSSig im Kreise der Liebsten - sei es zum Kaffeetrinken, Grillen oder Feierabendbier. Kleines Manko: Im Sommer ladt der chaotische Garten mit Mini-Balkon nicht gerade zum Verweilen ein. Das soll sich jetzt andern. Eine Terrasse muss schnellstens gebaut werden; und zwar in Eigenregie. Doch wenn drei Generationen am Werk sind, bleiben Meinungsverschiedenheiten leider nicht aus.

<sub-title>Einsam vs. gemeinsam auf dem Bau</sub-title>
<desc>Steffi (31) hat fur sich und ihren Freund Hartmut (43) ein Schnappchen-Fachwerkhaus erstanden. Nach dem Kauf entpuppte sich das stutzende Holzgebalk aber als derart marode, dass Steffi und Hartmut das Gefache herausschlagen mussten, um die morschen Balken ersetzen zu konnen. Nun ist Steffi Besitzerin eines Hauserskeletts auf einem 200qm groSSen Grundstuck. Doch trotz der ungunstigen Ausgangslage hat die Hausbesitzerin einen ehrgeizigen Zeitplan. Nur drei Wochen gibt sie sich und ihrem Freund Zeit, um die Bauruine bezugsfertig zu machen. Bewerkstelligen soll dieses Wunder Hartmut, der das Haus fast im Alleingang von Grund auf neu aufbauen soll. Auf groSSe Hilfe kann er nicht zahlen, denn Steffi arbeitet unter der Woche im Buro und es fehlt an Geld, um professionelle Hilfe zu engagieren. Nur 25.000 Euro stehen zur Verfugung, um aus dem Holzgerust ein Haus zu machen. Ein Himmelfahrtskommando, dem schon nach wenigen Tagen das endgultige Aus droht - das Ordnungsamt entzieht dem Paar die Baugenehmigung! Damit nicht genug, die hoffnungslose Lage stellt die Beziehung auf eine ZerreiSSprobe. Zerbricht die Vision von Haus und gemeinsamer Zukunft an Burokratie und Baustress? Auch Ralf (40) und Ehefrau Silvia (48) erfullen sich mit Tochter Melanie (9) den Traum vom Eigenheim. Fur nur 35 000 Euro erwerben sie ein 120 Quadratmeter groSSes Reihenhaus. Innerhalb von 3 Monaten soll das 111 Jahre alte Anwesen wieder flott und einzugsbereit gemacht werden. Doch marode Wasserleitungen und Holzwurmbefall fressen schon zu Beginn der Sanierung den GroSSteil des Budgets auf. Dann spruht auch noch der Stromanschluss Funken. Allein konnen die beiden Bauherren die Baustelle nicht bewaltigen. Doch das Geld fur Profis fehlt und die Wohnung ist bereits gekundigt. Zum Gluck hat die Familie gute Freunde, die ihnen beim Bau unter die Arme greifen. Doch wird ihr Einsatz reichen?</desc>

<title>Mordet p√• Orientexpressen</title>
<desc>Det ar vintern 1935 och den lyxiga Orientexpressen dundrar fram p√• sin vag mellan Istanbul och Calais. Mitt i natten tvingas t√•get stanna eftersom sp√•ret ar blockerat av snomassor. P√• morgonen hittas industrimagnaten Ratchett mordad med tolv knivhugg, trots att hans kupe var l√•st. Nu galler det for masterdetektiven Hercule Poirot att snabbt losa fallet innan ovadret bedarrar och passagerarna p√• t√•get skingras for vinden. Det visar sig snart att m√•nga av de ombordvarande hade motiv att doda Ratchett. Regi: Sidney Lumet. I rollerna: Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave m.fl. (Murder on the Orient Express)</desc>

<title>Jag ar monstret _ filmen om Freddie Wadling</title>
<desc>F√• svenska artister har lamnat ett s√• oforglomligt avtryck som Freddie Wadling (1951-2016) - och f√• ar lika mytomspunna. Med en rost som strackte sig fr√•n de djupaste brunnarna till de himmelska hojderna, benamndes han ofta som "Sveriges basta rockrost". Filmen utforskar Wadlings morka livsode och fascinerande karriar - fr√•n hans tid med band som Cortex, Blue for Two och Flaskkvartetten, till hans solokarriar som omfattade allt fr√•n elektronisk musik till finstamda visor. Trots sin kultstatus kampade Wadling med scenskrack och ett liv praglat av alkohol och droger. En revanschhistoria om en utstott kille som fick ett oerhort anseende och skrev in sig i den svenska musikhistorien. Svensk dokumentar fr√•n 2025 av Lars Hogeus och Robert Lagerstrom.</desc>

Vanamehe kahtlused tulevad aga hooga tagasi, kui rahahadas Greg asub teisele tookohale uhes ravimikompaniis.

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<sub-title>Des racines et des ailes</sub-title>
<desc>Realise par Nicolas Bourgouin Redactrice en chef : Karine Abderrahim Une production France 3, Eclectic Avec la participation de France Televisions Une emission presentee par Carole Gaessler PASSION PATRIMOINE : SUR LA PISTE DES TRAFIQUANTS DART En France, chaque annee, 500 000 objets sont pilles sur des fouilles archeologiques. Nos eglises, nos cathedrales, nos basiliques ne sont pas epargnees non plus. Un trafic mondial aussi lucratif que celui des armes et de la drogue‚Ä¶ Pendant deux ans, "Des racines and des ailes" a suivi archeologues, experts, conservateurs qui traquent sans rel√¢che pilleurs et faussaires. Dans le sud de la France, Xavier Delestre, conservateur √† la DRAC, se bat pour preserver du pillage les 36 000 sites archeologiques de la region PACA. Son travail permet de retrouver les objets voles, proposes √† la vente sur internet, et de les restituer. En Mediterranee, larcheologue sous-marine Franca Cibecchini dirige des fouilles durgence destinees √† sauver les tresors dune epave, le Fort Royal, echoue il y a plus de 2 000 ans au large de Cannes. Un site aux richesses inestimables. Des trafics amplifies par les guerres et les conflits‚Ä¶ En Libye, le superbe site de Cyr√®ne, classe √† lUnesco, sest vu depouille de nombreux tresors, notamment pendant les printemps arabes. Larcheologue Vincent Michel part √† la recherche des sculptures pillees et dispersees √† travers le monde. Depuis toujours, les faussaires jettent une ombre sur le marche de lart. Exceptionnellement, le Louvre ouvre ses reserves et rev√®le les faux dont il a malheureusement fait lacquisition : une copie de Denner, peintre du XVIIIe si√®cle, et une tiare en or, plus vraie que nature, achetee √† tort par le departement des objets archeologiques √† la fin du XIXe si√®cle.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<title>El crimen de Cuenca</title>
<desc>Dos amigos de la localidad conquense de Osa de la Vega son detenidos como autores de la muerte de su compa√±ero, el pastor Jose Mar√≠a Grimaldos. Tras ser torturados, los amigos confiesan un crimen que no han cometido y son juzgados y condenados a dieciocho a√±os de c√°rcel. Segunda cinta dirigida por Pilar Miro y una de las que m√°s problemas le causaron, pues fue la primera pel√≠cula "secuestrada" tras la desaparicion de la censura durante la Transicion y estuvo casi un a√±o y medio prohibida. Protagonizado por Jose Manuel Cervino, Daniel Dicenta, Amparo Soler, Hector Alterio y Guillermo Montesinos, el filme est√° basada en los hechos reales ocurridos en 1910 en el peque√±o pueblo de Osa de la Vega (Cuenca), donde dos hombres inocentes fueron acusados del asesinato de un pastor que, como se descubrio despues, segu√≠a con vida. Una historia que gira en torno a una humillacion, una amistad, un error y una indigna manera de actuar de la justicia.</desc>

<sub-title>Wer sorgt fur unsere Sicherheit? Das Comeback des Bunkers</sub-title>
<desc>Theoretisch gibt es in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Schutzraume fur 480.000 Menschen. Das entspricht etwa 0,56 % der Bevolkerung. Praktisch lautet die Zahl der Platze jedoch: Null. Denn im Zweifel ist keine der 579 Bunkeranlagen einsatzbereit. Es gibt kein Wasser oder keinen Strom, die Bunker werden vermietet, wurden verkauft oder sind seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gewartet. Deutschland steht in Sachen Zivilschutz blank da. Nach 1990 wurden alle Atomschutzanlagen auSSer Dienst gestellt, die ubrigen Bunkeranlagen zu Geld gemacht, eingemottet oder zu Wohnungen oder Kultureinrichtungen umgewidmet. Als ware mit der deutschen Wiedervereinigung eine √Ñra des ewigen Friedens angebrochen. Das Bundesamt fur Bevolkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe verweist auf U-Bahnhofe oder Keller, in die sich die Bevolkerung bei Bedarf fluchten soll. SchlieSSlich sei die Qualitat des Bauens in Deutschland auSSergewohnlich hoch. Nicht alle wollen sich mit solchen Beschwichtigungen zufriedenzugeben. Seit Beginn des Kriegs in der Ukraine boomt der private Bunkerbau. "√úber 70 Prozent unserer Kundschaft sind Frauen", sagt Mario Piejde von der Berliner Firma BSSD. Vor dem Hintergrund der gestiegenen Kriegsgefahr und taglich wachsender Zweifel an der Einsatzbereitschaft der Bundeswehr und NATO widmet sich "aspekte" dem Comeback des Bunkers. 80 Jahre nach Ende des 2. Weltkriegs steigt "aspekte" in alte Bunker, besichtigt neue Bunker und wundert sich uber nicht vorhandene Bunker. Jo Schuck erkundet mit dem Verein "Berliner Unterwelten" die Spuren des Luftkriegs unter dem Pflaster der Hauptstadt und spricht mit dem Militarhistoriker Sonke Neitzel uber die aktuelle Kriegsgefahr. Architekt Andreas Knapp fuhrt durch den zum Kulturort umgebauten Bilker Bunker in Dusseldorf, ein ehemaliger NVA-Kommandant gibt Einblicke in die groSSte Bunkeranlage Deutschlands. Den Stollenkomplex bei Halberstadt, den KZ-Haftlinge einst in den Berg getrieben haben, wollte ein sachsischer Immobilienunternehmer zu luxuriosen Schutzraumen umbauen. Weil die Anlage unter Denkmalschutz steht, muss er seine Plane nun deutlich abspecken. DJ Paula Schopf steht regelmaSSig auf der Buhne des Deutschen Theaters Berlin ("Mein Herz dein Bunker - 290 BPM") und kann sich noch gut erinnern, wie die junge Techno-Szene Anfang der 90er-Jahre in Bunkern ihren Freiraum fand. Anselm Kiefer, der vor 80 Jahren in einem Luftschutzkeller geboren wurde, und Regisseur Joshua Oppenheimer ("The End"), der ein Bunker-Musical mit Tilda Swinton ins Kino bringt, fragt "aspekte" nach der Sinnhaftigkeit der neuen Bunkerwelle: Was nutzt der schonste Bunker, wenn vor den Bunkerturen die Welt untergeht?</desc>

<title>Wilde Zeiten. Das letzte Jahr der DDR</title>
<desc>Als 1989 die Mauer fallt, ist nichts mehr so wie vorher. Das Jahr bis zur Wiedervereinigung ist wild, verruckt und chaotisch. Keiner weiSS, was die Zukunft bringt, alles scheint moglich. Nach 40 Jahren sozialistischer Diktatur bricht plotzlich die staatliche Kontrolle weg. Viele DDR-Burger fuhlen sich befreit, viele aber auch verunsichert und allein gelassen. Im ganzen Land herrscht eine Stimmung zwischen Aufbruch und Die Ersturmung der Stasi-Zentrale in Ostberlin geht um die Welt. Aber die Burger der DDR raumen auch anderswo auf.

<sub-title>√Ñgypten - Natur schreibt Geschichte</sub-title>
<desc>Welche Krafte haben das alte √Ñgypten gepragt. Was waren die Grunde fur Aufstieg, Wohlstand und den dramatischen Niedergang des Pharaonenreichs? Naturgewalten spielten eine entscheidende Rolle. Hannah Emde reist zu gigantischen Tierskeletten in der Wuste, steigt nachts in uralte Grabkammern, versucht eine Kobra zu fangen und hilft mit bei einer Ausgrabung auf einer Insel im Nil. Der Nil: Lebensader und Schicksalsfluss Hannah Emde, Tierarztin, Artenschutzerin und Moderatorin von "Faszination Erde", macht sich in √Ñgypten auf eine spannende Reise. Sie beginnt auf dem Nil, der Lebensader √Ñgyptens - heute wie damals. Wie sicherte dieser machtige Fluss im alten √Ñgypten den Wohlstand des Landes? Die regelmaSSig auftretenden Fluten des Nils waren die Grundbedingung fur eine florierende Landwirtschaft. Doch die Natur ist launisch. Erst durch Innovationen gelang es, den Fluss zu zahmen. Nilometer, ausgeklugelte Bewasserungssysteme und ein tiefer Respekt vor der Natur halfen den √Ñgyptern, ihre Felder optimal zu bewirtschaften. Klimawandel in der Antike Hannah Emde erfahrt von gewaltigen Klimaveranderungen, die die Region im Laufe der Jahrtausende geformt haben: Das Kippen der Erdachse lieSS einst die Sahara in eine grune Savanne erbluhen, die erst spater zur Wuste wurde. So trieb die Natur die Menschen in neue Lebensraume - immer auf der Suche nach Wasser und fruchtbaren Boden. Das Niltal war wie ein Magnet fur die Menschen. Es war der fruhe Beginn der Entwicklung zur agyptischen Hochkultur. Naturkatastrophen und der Untergang der Pharaonen In den eisigen Tiefen Gronlands entdecken Forschende Beweise fur ein Naturereignis, das √Ñgyptens Schicksal besiegelte: Ein gewaltiger Vulkanausbruch auf den Aleuten-Inseln vor Alaska im Jahr 43 v. Chr. sorgte fur globale Klimaveranderungen. Die Fluten des Nils blieben aus, Durren und Hungersnote trieben viele Menschen in den Tod - ein Schicksalsschlag, den das Reich der Pharaonen nicht uberlebte. Die Kraft der Natur - gestern und heute Hannah Emde zeigt, dass die Geschichte √Ñgyptens nicht allein von Menschen geschrieben wurde. Es waren die Krafte der Natur - Wasser, Wind, Sand, Vulkane und das Klima - die den Lauf der Dinge immer wieder veranderten. Die Frage drangt sich auf: Welche Rolle wird die Natur in unserer eigenen Zukunft spielen? Drei Folgen "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Die beiden ersten Folgen steht bereits ab dem 5. Marz 2025 vorab in der ZDFmediathek zur Verfugung.</desc>

<title>Wunderwelt Chemie</title>
<sub-title>Die Bausteine der Natur</sub-title>
<desc>Woraus besteht die Welt? Diese Frage fasziniert Menschen seit jeher. Dr. Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim nimmt die Zuschauer mit auf eine Reise durch die Geschichte der Wissenschaft. In der Antike ging man von vier Elementen aus: Feuer, Wasser, Erde und Luft. Nach Jahrhunderten der Forschung sind heute 118 Elemente bekannt - und die Suche geht weiter. Entdeckt wurden sie von visionaren Mannern und Frauen, die Wissenschaftsgeschichte schrieben. Dass Festes flussig und Flussiges zu Gas werden konnte, inspirierte die fruhen Alchemisten, eine solche Verwandlungskunst selbst anzuwenden. Meist auf der Suche nach dem "Stein der Weisen", der unedle Metalle in Gold umwandeln sollte. Auch wenn alle Versuche ins Leere liefen, erbrachte doch mancher Irrweg wichtige Erkenntnisse. So der von Hennig Brand, der im Jahr 1669 versuchte, den Stein der Weisen aus Urin zu gewinnen, und dabei den Phosphor entdeckte. Viele Elemente wurden erst nach einer Kette von Irrtumern gefunden. Wie die Entdeckung des Sauerstoffs durch den Franzosen Antoine de Lavoisier, der damit die abenteuerliche Theorie des "Phlogistons" widerlegte, eines ominosen Stoffes, von dem man angenommen hatte, er entweiche bei Verbrennungen. 118 Elemente fuhrt das Periodensystem heute auf. Es ist nicht weniger als die Ordnung der Welt, die in Spalten und Gruppen nach der Kernladung und den chemischen Eigenschaften der Elemente aufgegliedert ist. Dieses Grundverstandnis verdankt die Wissenschaft dem Russen Dimitri Mendelejew, dem das Periodensystem der Legende nach im Traum erschien. Seine Leistung besteht nicht nur aus der Ordnung der bekannten Elemente, die er erstmals 1869 der √ñffentlichkeit prasentierte, sondern auch in der Definition der Leerstellen im Periodensystem. Er prophezeite, dass es dort noch Elemente geben musse, auch wenn man sie zu seiner Zeit noch nicht kannte. Mendelejew sollte recht behalten. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts begann erstmals eine Frau, die Lucken des Periodensystems zu fullen: Marie Curie. Sie entdeckte die Elemente Radium und Polonium. Bis zuletzt war sie vom Nutzen der radioaktiven Strahlung uberzeugt, die von ihnen ausging - etwa fur die Behandlung von Tumoren. Den Abwurf der erste Atombombe hat Curie nicht mehr erlebt. In dieser Folge der Reihe erklart Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim die Grundlagen einer faszinierenden Wissenschaft, der viele Menschen skeptisch gegenuberstehen. "Fur viele ist Chemie nur ein verhasstes Schulfach, das man nicht schnell genug abwahlen konnte, dabei erklart sie uns diese verruckte faszinierende Welt, in der wir leben", sagt die Wissenschaftsjournalistin. Drei Folgen "Terra X: Wunderwelt Chemie - Mit Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Alle Filme der Reihe sind bereits ab Montag, 4. Oktober, in der ZDFmediathek unter terra-X.zdf.de zu finden. Die erste Folge, "Die Bausteine der Natur", wird am Sonntag, 10. Oktober, um 10.00 Uhr auch auf dem YouTube-Kanal "Terra X" https://ly.zdf.de/tl1/ veroffentlicht.

<title>A Breath Away</title>
<desc>Nach einem Erdbeben wird Paris von einem giftigen Nebel heimgesucht, der die Bevolkerung zur Flucht in die Hohe zwingt. Auch Anna, Mathieu und ihre Tochter Sarah kampfen ums √úberleben. Durch eine seltene Immunkrankheit ist Sarah an eine immobile Sauerstoffkammer gebunden. Zur Sicherung ihrer lebensnotwendigen Isolation sind Mathieu und Anna zu allem bereit, wahrend Paris im Nebel und im Chaos versinkt. Sarah (Fantine Harduin), die Tochter der Wissenschaftler Anna (Olga Kurylenko) und Mathieu (Romain Duris), leidet an einer seltenen Immunerkrankung und ist dadurch gezwungen, in einer isolierten Sauerstoffkammer zu leben. Wahrend Mathieu regelmaSSig die Welt auf der Suche nach neuen Therapiemethoden fur Sarah bereist, priorisiert Anna die begrenzte Zeit mit ihrer Tochter. Unangekundigt wird Paris von einem schweren Erdbeben erschuttert, das einen giftigen Nebel freisetzt, der die Metropole zunachst nur bis zu einer bestimmten Hohe verschlingt. Mathieu und Anna finden in ihrem Wohnhaus Zuflucht bei dem alten Ehepaar Lucien (Michel Robin) und Colette (Anna Gaylor) im Dachgeschoss, wahrend Sarah in ihrer vor dem Nebel geschutzten Kammer ausharren muss. Sarahs Eltern sind bald dazu gezwungen, sich fur Besorgungen und die Inganghaltung von Sarahs Isolationskabine nach drauSSen zu wagen. Ob des Ausnahmezustands regiert in den StraSSen von Paris das Chaos. Als der Nebel plotzlich erneut zu steigen beginnt, mussen Mathieu und Anna unvermittelt eine Evakuierung von sich und Sarah vorbereiten. Das emotionale Katastrophendrama "A Breath Away" des kanadischen Regisseurs Daniel Roby konzentriert sich in erster Linie auf die menschlichen Aspekte seines dargestellten Unglucksszenarios. Dadurch grenzt sich die franzosisch-kanadische Produktion ein Stuck weit von den amerikanischen Blockbustern des Genres ab, die ihren Fokus oft auf die groSStmogliche Imposanz ihrer Endzeitbilder legen. Dennoch wurde die Herstellung der Katastrophensituation in "A Breath Away" alles andere als stiefmutterlich angegangen. So wurden beispielsweise fur den im Film omniprasenten Nebel verschiedene Farbtone hinsichtlich ihrer psychologischen Wirkung getestet, um einen moglichst toxischen und bedrohlichen Effekt sicherzustellen.</desc>

<desc>Tobias Kaiser, Chef eines Architekturburos, wurde kaltblutig erschossen, nachdem er im Kreise seiner Kollegen einen lukrativen Auftrag gefeiert hatte. Das "starke Team" ermittelt. Schnell stellt sich heraus, dass Kollegin Leyla Gunes den millionenschweren Auftrag an Land gezogen hatte und Kaiser dafur die Lorbeeren ernten wollte. Hat sie ihren Chef aus Rache erschossen, weil sie insgeheim hoffte, seinen Posten ubernehmen zu konnen? Otto und Linett finden heraus, dass Kaiser vor Kurzem in einen heftigen Streit verwickelt war, der offenbar handgreiflich endete: Hanna Beckmann hat als Praktikantin in Kaisers Architekturburo gearbeitet, bis zur absoluten Erschopfung. Ihr Vater, Julius Beckmann, scheint ein Mann furs Grobe zu sein. Hat er Kaiser gegenuber die Kontrolle verloren, als er ihn fur sein Fehlverhalten zur Rechenschaft ziehen wollte? Je tiefer das "starke Team" in diesen komplizierten Fall eintaucht, desto mehr potenzielle Tatverdachtige gibt es. Plotzlich wendet sich das Blatt, als Otto und Linett in einem weiteren Mordfall ermitteln mussen: Barkeeper Timo Feldkamp wird nach seiner Schicht in seiner eigenen Bar erschossen.

<title>Borderline - Meine Seele im Ausnahmezustand</title>
<desc>Borderline - eine Personlichkeitsstorung, bei der Depression und Freudenrausch nur einen Wimpernschlag voneinander entfernt sind. Es ist alles null oder hundert. Ein Leben lang. Aber Borderline ist nicht gleich Borderline. Jeder hat mit anderen Begleitern zu kampfen - ob mit instabilen Beziehungen, √Ñngsten oder Suizidgedanken. Es ist fur Betroffene schwer, ihren Alltag zu bewaltigen. Und ihre Familien sind oftmals uberfordert. Tara merkt in ihrer Pubertat, dass sie "anders" ist. Eltern und Mitschuler finden sie schwierig und anstrengend. Depressive und euphorische Phasen wechseln sich ab. Immer wieder kampft sie mit Panikattacken. Zudem fallt es ihr schwer, Freundschaften zu schlieSSen. Tara fuhlt sich oft einsam, will aber auch niemanden wirklich an sich heranlassen. Ihre Diagnose hat sie mit Erleichterung aufgenommen. Es hat ihr geholfen, sich selbst besser zu verstehen. Inzwischen gelingt es ihr auch mehr, anderen zu sagen, was ihr fehlt und was sie braucht. Trotzdem: Soziale Kontakte sind weiterhin schwierig fur sie. In Deutschland haben geschatzt drei bis vier Millionen Menschen eine Borderline-Personlichkeitsstorung. Die Betroffenen merken oftmals erst nach der Pubertat, dass ihre extremen "Stimmungsschwankungen" ernst zu nehmen sind. Die "37¬∞Leben"-Reportage ist ab Freitag, 14. Marz 2025, 8.00 Uhr, in der ZDFmediathek abrufbar.</desc>

<title>√ñkumenischer Gottesdienst</title>
<desc>Mantel, Blusen, Schuhe so weit das Auge reicht - ein Sachspendenlager ist der ungewohnliche Ort dieses Gottesdienstes. Ausgedruckt wird damit: Kleidung schenken heiSSt auch, Wurde schenken. Geleitet wird der okumenische Gottesdienst am zweiten Fastensonntag von Katharina Renner von der katholischen Caritas der Erzdiozese Wien und von Wolfgang Ernst, dem Rektor der evangelischen "Diakonie Eine Welt". Das Evangelium am zweiten Sonntag der √ñsterlichen BuSSzeit erinnert an das Gleichnis vom verlorenen Sohn. Als er zuruckkehrt, schenkt ihm der Vater als Erstes ein Kleidungsstuck. "Bringt schnell das beste Gewand", sagt der Vater. In der Predigt geht es um Kleidung und Wurde. Katharina Renner und Wolfgang Ernst sind uberzeugt: "Jeder Mensch hat es verdient, so gekleidet zu sein, dass er sich nicht schamen muss. Jeder hat es verdient, etwas Wurdevolles zum Anziehen zu haben." Musikalisch gestalten die Feier die Johann Sebastian Bach Musikschule Wien und die "POP Akademie" Wien. Nach dem Gottesdienst sind Mitglieder der Feiergemeinde telefonisch erreichbar. Anrufe aus Deutschland und √ñsterreich sind kostenlos. Die Nummer lautet: 0800 - 100 2260.

<title>Faszination Erde</title>
<sub-title>Peru ‚Äì Ein Land, vier Welten</sub-title>
<desc>In Peru treffen unvereinbare Welten aufeinander: An der Pazifikkuste erstreckt sich eine karge Wustenlandschaft, getrennt vom Amazonas-Regenwald durch Gletschergipfel der Anden. Hannah Emde ist fur "Terra X: Faszination Erde" unterwegs im Land der Gegensatze. In Perus extremen Lebensraumen ist der Grat zwischen Leben und Tod schmal. Ausgerechnet dort liegt eines der artenreichsten Gebiete der Welt, im groSSten tropischen Regenwald der Erde. An Perus knochentrockener Kuste ist Wildtierarztin Hannah Emde mit einer Meeresforscherin unterwegs, die den groSSten Fisch der Welt untersucht, den Walhai. Die bis zu zwolf Meter langen Riesen tummeln sich dort regelmaSSig im Ozean - normalerweise. Doch 2024 sind sie vollig uberraschend ausgeblieben - was konnte der Grund sein? Wie eng die extremen Lebensraume in Peru miteinander verknupft sind, zeigt sich beim Blick uber die Anden hinweg, Richtung Amazonas. Nebelwalder an den Hangen der Berge speichern Feuchtigkeit wie ein riesiger Schwamm. Sie speisen Quellen und Bache, die sich zu immer groSSeren Flussen vereinen, bis hin zum Amazonas. Doch das fein abgestimmte System konnte ins Wanken geraten. Durch steigende Temperaturen sind die Nebelwalder in Gefahr und damit auch der Wasserfluss. Aber ein Tier, das von den Einheimischen ehrfurchtig "Ukuku" genannt wird, konnte helfen. Bei uns in Europa ist der "Ukuku" unter einem anderen Namen bestens bekannt: Paddington! Als Kinderbuchfigur begeistert der Brillenbar aus Peru die Welt. Im Kinofilm "Paddington in Peru" ist er in seiner Heimat unterwegs und meistert groSSe Herausforderungen. Auch im realen Leben konnen die Brillenbaren helfen. Wie - das erfahrt Hannah von einer Forscherin, mit der sie sich auf die Suche nach den legendaren Baren macht. Im Amazonas-Regenwald kummert sich eine Wildtierauffangstation um Jaguare, die wieder ausgewildert werden sollen. Die Top-Pradatoren sind wichtig fur das Gleichgewicht im Regenwald. Sie halten die Anzahl der Pflanzenfresser in Schach und sorgen so dafur, dass sich der Wald verjungen kann. Der Tod auf der einen Seite bedeutet, dass das Leben auf der anderen Seite weitergeht. "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde" liefert einzigartige Einblicke in Perus Natur und zeigt, wie sich Leben und Tod in den extremen Welten des Landes seit Jahrtausenden die Waage halten. Die Folge ist bereits ab Mittwoch, 5. Marz 2025, in der ZDFmediathek abrufbar.</desc>

<title>Bomben auf Deutschland</title>
<desc>Alliierte Bomber trugen den Tod nach Deutschland. Die Luftangriffe kosteten im Zweiten Weltkrieg geschatzt 600.000 deutsche Zivilisten das Leben. "Terra X History" blickt zuruck. Jahrzehntelang wurde argumentiert, die britischen und amerikanischen Luftangriffe seien eine Folge deutscher Bomben auf Coventry und Rotterdam gewesen. Doch der Blick auf die Geschichte des Bombenkrieges hat sich nach acht Jahrzehnten verandert. Einen groSSen Teil der Bombenlast trugen die nordlich und westlich gelegenen Stadte. Allein in Hamburg starben rund 48.600 Menschen, gefolgt von Berlin mit 35.000 und Pforzheim mit 17.600 Toten. 80 Jahre nach den verheerenden Angriffen auf Dresden im Februar 1945 wirft "Terra X History" - gemeinsam mit renommierten Historikern - einen neuen Blick auf den Luftkrieg uber Deutschland - und seine Spuren bis heute. Privates Film- und Fotomaterial, zum Teil unmittelbar nach Luftangriffen aufgenommen, zeigen den Schrecken der Bombardements und die Folgen fur die Zivilbevolkerung.</desc>

<sub-title>Perfekte Kinder: Der Druck in Familien</sub-title>
<desc>Kinder wachsen oft mit Anspruchen auf, die Eltern und Gesellschaft haufig mit den besten Absichten an sie stellen. Was ist aber, wenn man von Geburt an keine Chance hat, dem zu entsprechen? Psychologe Leon Windscheid besucht Amelie Gerdes, die mit Trisomie 21 geboren wurde. Amelies Eltern erzahlen, wie sie die Geburt ihrer Tochter zunachst aus der Bahn geworfen hat und welche Rolle die Erwartungen der Leistungsgesellschaft dabei gespielt haben. Amelie und ihren Eltern Elke und Thomas geht es nicht alleine so. In einem Sozialexperiment ladt Leon zehn Menschen aus der Generation Z ein. Sie erzahlen offen und ehrlich, was ihnen im Leben Druck macht und wie dieser sich anfuhlt. Der Psychologe Prof. Thomas Curran aus London forscht zum Thema Perfektionismus und weiSS, dass das Verhalten von Eltern in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten zunehmend dazu fuhrt, dass Kinder und junge Menschen sich selbst als nicht gut genug einschatzen. Im Gesprach mit Leon Windscheid erklart er, wie fatal diese Entwicklung ist und welche Folgen dieser Perfektionismus fur das Selbstwertgefuhl junger Menschen haben kann. Dabei wollen die meisten Eltern fur ihre Kinder nur das Beste und werden vor allem von sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Faktoren, also von der Gesellschaft, zu womoglich schadlichem Verhalten veranlasst.</desc>

<sub-title>Frauen in der Armutsfalle: Viel Arbeit, wenig Lohn</sub-title>
<desc>Frauen verdienen im Job immer noch weniger als Manner. Zusatzlich schmeiSSen sie noch den Haushalt, erziehen Kinder und pflegen Angehorige. Ihr Armutsrisiko im Alter wird vollig unterschatzt. Viele Frauen kummern sich zu wenig um ihre Finanzen. Rund 70 Prozent der heute berufstatigen Frauen furchten, sich im Alter drastisch einschranken zu mussen. Hilde Fromm ist wutend. √úber die gesellschaftliche Ungerechtigkeit, dass sie ihr Leben lang fur ihre Arbeit generell schlechter bezahlt wurde als Manner. Aber auch uber sich selbst, weil die 68-Jahrige sich immer zu wenig Gedanken uber ihre finanzielle Situation gemacht hat. "√úber Geld spricht man nicht, sagte man fruher. So wurde ich erzogen, und so habe ich es ein Leben lang gehalten." Diese Sprachlosigkeit hat jedoch krasse Folgen: Als Rentnerin kommt Hilde Fromm finanziell kaum uber die Runden. Unterstutzung findet sie beim Verein Lebenshilfe e. V. Hier bekommt sie regelmaSSig Einkaufsgutscheine, eine warme Mahlzeit und trifft Frauen, denen es genauso geht wie ihr. Mandy Mewes und Jana Schutze befinden sich in der Mitte des Lebens. Das heiSSt vor allem eins: viel Arbeit. "Haushalt, Familie, Job - Sitzen tue ich eigentlich nur, wenn ich esse", berichtet Jana. Die 51-Jahrige arbeitete fruher als OP-Assistenz. Doch mit inzwischen vier Kindern, zwei Hunden und einem vollzeitarbeitendem Ehemann musste sie ihre Arbeitszeit einschranken. Der neue Teilzeitjob als Sterilisationsassistentin bringt rund 50 Prozent weniger Gehalt. Das hat drastische Auswirkungen auf Janas Rentenniveau. "Das macht man sich erstmal gar nicht klar, was Teilzeit fur langfristige Folgen hat." Mandy Mewes droht die Armut nicht erst im Alter, sondern schon jetzt. Die heute 47-Jahrige war jahrelang Gutverdienerin mit Dienstwagen, regelmaSSigen Urlaubsreisen und schicker Wohnung. Mit der Geburt ihrer Tochter und der Trennung vom Partner kam der finanzielle Absturz: "Wir mussen jeden Cent zweimal umdrehen. Ein Besuch im Eiscafe ist fur mich heute ein kaum bezahlbarer Luxus." Studentin Laura Stuhldreier will gar nicht erst in eine solche Situation kommen. "Wenns um die eigenen Finanzen geht, sollte jede Frau selbst aktiv werden", findet die 22-Jahrige. Jeden Monat legt sie kleinste Betrage ihres Studentenbudgets in Aktien an. Was erstmal nach sehr wenig aussieht rechnet sich langfristig sehr wohl. Eine "ZDF.reportage" uber Frauen in der finanziellen Armutsfalle.</desc>
