<title>Documerica - Bilder eines vergangenen Landes</title>
<desc>Von der Industrie verunstaltete Landschaften, von Mullbergen und Autoschrott verschandelte Natur: "Documerica" zeichnet ein schonungsloses Bild der USA Anfang der 70er Jahre. Das Fotoprogramm wurde von der Umweltschutzagentur EPA ins Leben gerufen, um die Zerstorung der Umwelt zu dokumentieren. "Documerica" war eine Folge des wachsenden okologischen Problembewusstseins in der Bevolkerung. US-Prasident Richard Nixon modernisierte und institutionalisierte die Umweltpolitik des Landes und forderte, die USA sollten "Frieden mit der Natur" schlieSSen. Ab 1972 bereisten rund hundert Fotografinnen und Fotografen die Vereinigten Staaten. Ihre Aufnahmen zeigen die Gesellschaft jener Zeit und ihre Lebensbedingungen als verstorendes Mosaik, da das Land an die Grenzen des "American Dream" und des permanenten Wachstums auf Kosten der Natur stoSSt. "Documerica" steht in der Tradition anderer von der US-Bundesebene initiierter Projekte, verfehlte jedoch seine historische Mission. Abertausende von Fotografien gerieten in den nachfolgenden Jahrzehnten in Vergessenheit. Die Dokumentation vermischt personliche Geschichten mit historischen Ereignissen. Fotografinnen und Fotografen kommentieren die Bilder von damals und fangen die heutigen USA mit der Kamera ein. Die Gegenuberstellung zeigt, dass sich die Umweltproblematik schon in den 70er Jahren unubersehbar abzeichnete: "Es war alles da, vor unseren Augen", so der Fotograf Arthur Tress, "wir leben immer noch in der Documerica-Welt".</desc>

<title>Tracks East</title>
<desc>Die groteske Realitat des System-Pops offenbart eine Kulturpolitik, die Zensur, Patriotismus und politische Inszenierung vereint - und entsprechend zu einer bizarren, systemkonformen Musiklandschaft fuhrt. In Russland hat die Propagandamaschine neue Musikschaffende hervorgebracht, die die Vorlieben der Jugend mit staatlich geforderten Inhalten verbinden. Newcomerin Bearwolf etwa verkundet in ihrem Song "Ein Krieger allein auf dem Feld" patriotische Werte, die zur Zeit des Krieges gezielt vermittelt werden. In den Schulen sollen ab 2025 patriotische Lieder unter Anleitung von Kunstlern wie Shaman gelehrt werden. Der russische Investigativjournalist Pavel Kanygin untersucht, wie Musik immer haufiger zur Waffe politischer Inszenierung wird. Auch in Usbekistan wird Musik zunehmend kontrolliert. Das staatliche Uzbekconcert vergibt Lizenzen an Kunstlerinnen und Kunstler, damit sie offentlich auftreten durfen. Wer ohne Lizenz auf Konzerten oder Hochzeiten spielt, riskiert hohe Strafen. Der Rapper Konsta nutzt "conscious Rap" als Mittel, um soziale Missstande zu thematisieren, ohne die Zensurbehorden zu provozieren. Seit Oktober 2022 saSS der iranische Rapper Saman Yasin wegen seiner regimekritischen Texte in Haft. Im Zusammenhang mit den Protesten "Frau, Leben, Freiheit" wurde der aus dem kurdischen Teil Irans stammende Rapper in einem Schauprozess zum Tode verurteilt. Im Gefangnis wurde er schwer gefoltert und misshandelt. Nun ist Saman Yasin frei und in Deutschland angekommen.</desc>

<desc>Der Winter hat das Gebirgstal, in dem die Raubkatze mit ihren drei Jungen lebt, fest im Griff. Ein Mantel des Schweigens hat sich uber die majestatische Landschaft gebreitet: Die Singvogel sind in den Suden geflogen, nur ein paar Gras- und Aasfresser sind noch hiergeblieben und naturlich die Menschen mit ihren Hausern, StraSSen und Autos. Nachts zieht die Familie los, um zu fressen. Dazu fuhrt die Mutter fuhrt ihre Jungen zu der Beute, die sie zuvor gerissen hat. Doch diese Ausfluge sind nicht ungefahrlich. Die Pumamutter halt standig Ausschau nach Wolfen, Baren oder anderen Berglowen, die eine Gefahr fur ihre Jungen darstellen. Wahrend der Nachwuchs lernt, wie man in der Wildnis uberlebt, stellen Natur und Mensch die Raubkatze mit ihren Jungen vor schwere Herausforderungen: Ein groSSer Berglowe hat die Familie gewittert. Mannliche Pumas haben ausgedehntere Jagdgebiete als die Weibchen und dringen manchmal in deren Reviere ein, um deren Jungtiere zu toten und sich dann mit der Mutter zu paaren. Das Pumaweibchen legt eine strategische Fahrte, um den feindlich gesinnten Lowen von ihrer Hohle wegzufuhren. Sie muss sich weit entfernen, damit ihre Jungen in Sicherheit sind. Doch es vergeht viel Zeit bis die Puma-Mutter zuruckkehren kann, und eines der Kleinen wird von Ungeduld und Hunger ubermannt. Es macht sich schlieSSlich auf die Suche nach seiner Mutter, wahrend seine beiden Geschwister in der Hohle zuruckbleiben. Wird das Pumaweibchen das Junge wiederfinden? Kurz vor dem Sommer bereitet sich die Familie darauf vor, ihre Hohle zu verlassen, denn es ist an der Zeit, den Hirschrudeln in ihre Sommerreviere zu folgen.</desc>

<title>Connemara</title>
<sub-title>Connemara: Wie das Land, so das Pony</sub-title>
<desc>Connemara liegt am Atlantik im auSSersten Westen Irlands. Es ist ein wilder Landstrich, mit windgepeitschten Halbinseln, felsigen Mooren und schroffen Bergen. Diese raue Natur ist das Reich eines faszinierenden Pferdes: des Connemara-Ponys, der einzigen einheimischen Rasse auf Irland. Zu den treuen Vierbeinern empfinden insbesondere die alteingesessenen Bewohner der Region eine tiefe Verbundenheit. SchlieSSlich ist es nicht lange her, dass die Connemara-Ponys den Menschen hier das √úberleben sicherten. Die kraftigen und widerstandsfahigen Arbeitstiere wurden uberall in der Gegend zum Ackerbau und Transport eingesetzt. Sie gehorten mit zur Familie. Zwar sind diese Zeiten langst vorbei, doch noch immer identifizieren sich viele bodenstandige Einheimische mit ihren geliebten Ponys. Connemara ist die Wiege einer Rasse, die fur ihre Ausdauer und Freundlichkeit bekannt ist und bei Wettbewerben in vielen Disziplinen hervorragende Leistungen erbringt: ob in der Rasse-Show oder auf dem Hindernis-Parcours. Verschiedene Kreuzungen mit iberischen Pferden und englischen Vollblutern haben nach und nach das Aussehen dieses muskulosen Ponys gepragt. Inzwischen wachst die Nachfrage unter Zuchtern weltweit; selbst in Asien interessiert man sich heute fur die groSSartigen Ponys aus Connemara. Hohepunkt des Jahres in Irland ist fur Pony-Enthusiasten die Clifden Pony Show. Sie ist eine wahre Institution und das weltweit groSSte Treffen von Liebhabern des beruhmten Connemara-Ponys. Diese jahrliche Messe findet im Herzen der kleinen Hauptstadt der Region statt, wo die besten Zuchter jedes Jahr darauf hoffen, die hochste Trophae, eine "rote Rosette", an den Hals ihres besten Pferdes zu heften. Die Pony Show setzt auch eine irische Tradition fort - die Zuchtschau, ein echter Schonheitswettbewerb, bei dem die vielversprechendsten Connemara-Ponys in verschiedenen Kategorien ausgezeichnet werden. Und wer etwas auf sich halt als Zuchter dieser Rasse, der muss hier dabei sein.</desc>

<title>Schimpansen im Kongo mit Jane Goodall</title>
<desc>Alles beginnt Anfang der 90er Jahre, als Jane Goodall auf einem Markt im kriegsgebeutelten Zaire zufallig ein angekettetes Schimpansenbaby entdeckt. Bei diesem tragischen Anblick fasst sie den Entschluss, verwaisten Schimpansen zu helfen. Anhand von einzigartigem und bisher unveroffentlichtem Filmmaterial verfolgt die Dokumentation Janes auSSergewohnliche Reise, beginnend mit der Flucht vor Waffengewalt in Kinshasa und der ersten Evakuierung von Tieren in den sicheren Zoo von Brazzaville. Jane erkennt, dass sie ein dauerhaftes Zuhause fur die wachsende Zahl verwaister Schimpansen finden muss. Die UN-Friedensbotschafterin sichert ein geeignetes Grundstuck und die Finanzierung fur eine Auffangstation in der Republik Kongo: Tchimpounga ist geboren. Der erste Bewohner der Station ist aber gar keine Waise, sondern der alte Schimpanse Gregoire, der aus Einzelhaft und Misshandlung gerettet wurde. Er bringt seinen Pfleger Jean Maboto mit, den ersten standigen Mitarbeiter der Auffangstation. Wahrend seines Aufenthalts in Tchimpounga geht Gregoire eine enge Bindung mit dem Schimpansenweibchen La Vielle ein und wird sogar beruhmt, als er zusammen mit Jane Goodall auf dem Titelblatt der Zeitschrift National Geographic erscheint. Er stirbt im Alter von 66 Jahren und ist damit der alteste bekannte Schimpanse in Afrika.Nach Gregoires Tod wird La Vielle zur Ersatzmutter fur viele der Schimpansenkinder, die in der Rettungsstation leben. Eine davon ist Lemba. Sie hat Polio und ist in der Folge vollstandig gelahmt. Die Pfleger beginnen eine intensive Physiotherapie an Lembas Armen und Beinen. Wie groSS sind ihre Fortschritte?</desc>

<title>Ring frei fur Sambias Boxerinnen!</title>
<desc>Das Leben hat es lange nicht gut gemeint mit Margret, Lina oder Melody. In einem Land, wo Frauen noch immer wenig zahlen, wo Bildung nur an wenige Privilegierte vergeben wird und die Armut bis heute einen GroSSteil der Menschen lahmt, lagen ihre Chancen auf ein eigenstandiges und selbstbestimmtes Leben bei null. Doch sie sind dabei, sich freizuboxen, und das im wortlichen Sinne. Die jungen Frauen gehoren zu der immer groSSer werdenden Anzahl weiblicher Boxerinnen in Sambia, die ihr Schicksal selber in die Hand nehmen. Motiviert durch ihre individuellen Schicksale - Margret will ihre Mutter aus der Armut befreien, Lina ihren Sohn zu sich holen und Melody endlich nicht mehr herumgestoSSen werden -, sind sie doch unterschiedlich erfolgreich in ihren Bestrebungen. Wahrend Lina bereits als internationale Profiboxerin kampft und Margret zur Meisterin ihrer Gewichtsklasse aufgestiegen ist, gehoren die meisten zum Heer der namenlosen Boxerinnen, die auf ihre Chance hoffen. Fur Melody konnte sich dieser Traum demnachst sogar erfullen. Sie darf gegen eine der erfolgreichsten Gegnerinnen ihres Viertels antreten - ausgerechnet gegen Margret, gegen die viele andere Frauen aus Melodys Boxstall bisher verloren haben. Wird sie, die junge, bisher von der Konkurrenz kaum wahrgenommene Kampferin, den SpieSS diesmal umdrehen konnen?

<sub-title>Schottland: Shortbread</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Shortbread, die Kronung der schottischen Teatime Mit vornehm abgespreiztem kleinem Finger fuhrt Journalistin Nawelle Senad ihre Teetasse zum Mund. Sie hat sich mit Kochin Jazmin Spears zum schottischen Afternoon Tea getroffen, bei dem traditionell Shortbread gereicht wird. Das Murbeteiggeback ist aus Schottland nicht mehr wegzudenken. Geograf und Ernahrungswissenschaftler Pierre Raffard erzahlt die Geschichte des Zuckers und erklart die soziale Funktion der britischen Teesalons, welche bald schon international kopiert wurden. (2): Nostalgiegeschmack: Eva, eine Schottin in Portugal Die Schottin Eva lebt seit 1973 in Portugal. Bei sich zu Hause in Cascais serviert sie ihren Freunden eine Spezialitat aus der alten Heimat: Haggis. Sie erzahlt, wie sie jeder ihrer Begegnungen eine typisch schottische Note verleiht und wie sie kochen lernte, um die Gerichte ihrer Kindheit nach Portugal zu holen. (3): Ran an die Topfe! Appetit bekommen? Hier gibt es ein einfaches Shortbread-Rezept, das sich leicht nachbacken lasst. Also: Ran an die Topfe! _____________________ Rezept fur Millionaires Shortbread: Eine Schicht Keks, eine Schicht Karamell, eine Schicht Schokolade - und fertig ist das Shortbread fur Millionare oder solche, die es werden wollen. Zutaten fur 24 Shortbreads: 270 g Butter (Raumtemperatur) 100 g Kristallzucker ¬Ω TL Salz 100 g Vollrohrzucker 190 g Mehl 397 g (eine Dose) gesuSSte Kondensmilch ¬Ω TL Vanilleextrakt 200 g Milchschokolade Zubereitung: Fur die Murbeteigschicht: Backofen auf 160¬∞C vorheizen. Rechteckige, ofenfeste Form mit Backpapier auslegen. 170 g Butter auf Raumtemperatur und 100 g Zucker vermischen. Danach das Mehl dazugeben. Masse zu einem Teig kneten und in die Backform pressen. 35 Min. bei 170¬∞C backen. Am Ende der Backzeit sollte die Oberflache trocken und leicht goldbraun sein. Abkuhlen lassen. Fur die Karamellschicht: 100 g Butter, 100 g Vollrohrzucker und die Kondensmilch in einen Topf geben. Unter standigem Umruhren leicht erhitzen, bis der Zucker vollstandig aufgelost ist. Weiterkochen lassen, bis die Mischung karamellfarben ist. Auf den Murbeteig gieSSen und abkuhlen lassen. Fur die Schokoladenschicht: Schokolade im Wasserbad schmelzen und auf den abgekuhlten Karamell gieSSen. Das Ganze mindestens eine Stunde in den Kuhlschrank stellen.

<sub-title>Jamaica Kincaid / New York / Mosambik / Korsika</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Jamaica Kincaid, die rebellische Schriftstellerin von Antigua Jamaica Kincaids √ÑuSSerungen sind aufruhrerisch und befreiend zugleich. Als zentrale Figur der postkolonialen Literatur ist sie die aufsassige Stimme und Feder von Antigua und Barbuda, dem kleinen, von GroSSbritannien unabhangigen karibischen Inselstaat. Kincaid lebt inzwischen in den USA und spricht offen uber den jetzigen und ehemaligen Zustand ihrer Heimat. Ihr Volk herauszufordern oder die Menschen wachzurutteln, macht ihr keine Angst, genauso wenig wie die Zensur seitens der unabhangigen Regierung ihres Landes. (2): New York: Voguing als Ausdrucksform In New York lehrt der inzwischen weltweit beruhmte Tanzstil Voguing Selbstliebe. Der Tanz, dessen Name von dem Modemagazin "Vogue" stammt, ist eine kunstlerische Ausdrucksform, die darin besteht, auf ubertriebene Art Models zu imitieren und mit gespielter Arroganz die Buhne einzunehmen. Madonna machte ihn mit ihrem weltweiten Erfolgshit "Vogue" beruhmt. Voguing ist jedoch mehr als ein origineller urbaner Tanzstil. Es handelt sich um eine Bewegung, die das Emanzipationsstreben der LGBTQI+-Gemeinschaft widerspiegelt. (3): Mosambik: Angelinas Huhnchen mit Erdnussen Angelina bereitet in Maputo fur ihren Sohn und ihre Enkel ein traditionelles Gericht zu. Sie zermahlt Erdnusse zu Puder. Dann reibt sie eine Kokosnuss und mischt die daraus gewonnene Milch mit den Erdnussen. Die SoSSe reichert sie mit Zwiebeln und Tomaten an und fugt schlieSSlich Huhnchen hinzu. Einfach aber kostlich!

Der Maler Claude Monet bereitete fur die Expo die bedeutendste Retrospektive seiner Karriere vor: Gemalde aus seinem 25-jahrigen Schaffen, aber auch neue Werke, die zusammen mit Skulpturen des Bildhauers Auguste Rodin gezeigt werden sollten. Monet war daran gelegen, sich als moderner Kunstler zu prasentieren. Auf der Suche nach auSSergewohnlichen Landschaften begab er sich in die Creuse. In der eher unwirtlichen Gegend entdeckte Monet ein neues kunstlerisches Ausdrucksmittel: die Serie. Sie sollte die Arbeit des Malers bis zu seinem Lebensende pragen. (2): Brasilien: Ein Tanz gegen die Sklaverei Die Tanzprozession Bumba-meu-boi hat in Brasilien lange Tradition. Sie erinnert an eine Zeit, als die afro-brasilianische Bevolkerung als Sklaven in den Zuckerrohrplantagen schuften musste und diente den Armen immer auch als Moglichkeit, die Eliten zu kritisieren und zu verspotten. Bumba-meu-boi basiert auf einer mundlichen √úberlieferung, die besagt, das einst ein Sklave den Ochsen seines Herrn getotet haben soll. Seither spielen die Sklaven und ihre Nachkommen diesen Akt des Widerstands in einer Prozession nach, die afrikanisches und katholisches Brauchtum miteinander verschmilzt. Im 20.Jahrhundert wurde Bumba-meu-boi - bis dahin von den weiSSen Eliten verachtet - zum festen Bestandteil des brasilianischen Kulturerbes. (3): Hannover: Die Rinderrouladen von Klaus Wenn Klaus Rinderrouladen zubereitet, schwelgt er automatisch in Kindheitserinnerungen, denn sie sind ein typisches Sonntagsgericht. Sie bestehen aus dunnen Rindfleischscheiben, die mit Senf bestrichen und mit einer Mischung aus Speck, Gewurzgurken und gehackten Schalotten belegt werden. AnschlieSSend wird das Ganze zusammengerollt und in Bruhe geschmort. Wenn die Roulade beim Kochen nicht auseinanderfallt, ist ein Festmahl garantiert! (4): USA: Jazzklange im WeiSSen Haus Washington ist seit 1791 nicht nur Amtssitz samtlicher US-Prasidenten, sondern hat auch jede Menge groSSer Jazz-Musiker hervorgebracht. Lange Zeit gab es zwischen der Welt des Jazz und der Welt der Politik keine Beruhrungspunkte - bis ein Musiker versuchte, auf zwei Hochzeiten zu tanzen ...</desc>

Frostige Momente begleiten sein Leben: Das Herbstlaub fegt er in Badehose und Flipflops, selbst die Trauung mit Ehefrau Jessica fand in der Eistonne statt.

Die dafur verwendeten Fische tragen drollige Namen wie Meersau, Knurrhahn oder GeiSSbrasse. An der C√¥te Bleue bekommt Journalistin Clemence Fournival von Koch Yvan Vahanian ein Dreigangemenu rund um die Bouillabaisse serviert. Der Geograf und Ernahrungswissenschaftler Pierre Raffard erklart, woher die Bouillabaisse eigentlich stammt, wie sie sich verbreitete und welche Rolle sie in der franzosischen Kultur spielt. (2): Kulinarische Mitbringsel Journalistin Clemence Fournival geht provenzalische Produkte einkaufen: Pommes aus Kichererbsen (panisses), Olivenpasten (tapenades) und eine Zitronenlimonade (PAC Citron), die an heiSSen Tagen fur Erfrischung sorgt.

Sein einzigartiger Pinselstrich und sein Blick fur das Besondere verewigten das feierlustige Paris zu Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts auf Plakaten und Gemalden. (2): In Australien: Wie ein Bumerang Das L-formige Wurfobjekt fasziniert jeden, der es in die Hande nimmt. Ein Bumerang ist weit mehr als ein Spielzeug: Er symbolisiert sowohl die Tradition der australischen Ureinwohner als auch die Aneignung des Landes durch die WeiSSen. Wer sich zum Bumerang bekennt, zeigt seine Angehorigkeit zum australischen Volk.

<desc>(1): Toskana: Heimat von Pinocchio Pinocchio ist das Geschopf von Meister Geppetto - und der bitterbosen Vorstellungswelt des toskanischen Schriftstellers Carlo Collodi (1826-1890). Sein 1883 erschienenes Buch hat mit der Filmversion von Walt Disney aus dem Jahr 1940 nur wenig gemein, denn anders als die frohliche Zeichentrickmarionette, die sich lieber amusiert anstatt zur Schule zu gehen, erwacht Collodis Pinocchio in einer grausamen Gesellschaft zum Leben, in der Ungerechtigkeit und Elend herrschen. Dank ihrer universellen Botschaft zahlt die Coming-of-Age-Story, die in mehr als 200 Sprachen ubersetzt wurde, zu den meistverkauften italienischen Buchern der Welt. (2): New York: Im Kreuzfeuer der Graffiti-Sprayer Graffiti kann vieles sein: ein dekorativer Farbtupfer im tristen GroSSstadtgrau, der Wunsch, sich an einer Mauer zu verewigen, oder auch ein Ausdruck des Protests gegen Ungerechtigkeiten. Was in New York einst als vandaischer Auswuchs einer orientierungslosen Jugend abgetan wurde, hat sich uber die Jahre zu einer eigenstandigen Kunstdisziplin entwickelt. Wahrend Graffiti fruher fur Gewalt und Elend stand, genieSSt es heute ein hohes Ansehen und gilt als ein Symbol der Gentrifizierung, die in New Yorks ehemaligen Arbeitervierteln Einzug gehalten hat. (3): Kolumbien: Angelas Garnelen in Kokossauce Im Herzen von Bogot√° serviert Angela eine Spezialitat von der ecuadorianischen Kuste: Encocado. Das Gericht wird traditionell mit Fisch zubereitet, doch Angela bevorzugt Garnelen, die sie in einer SoSSe aus Kokosmilch, Knoblauch und Paprika schmort. Dazu reicht sie Kochbananenfladen und Reis.

<desc>November, 1943: 2.000 auf der Insel Keros von den Deutschen eingeschlossene britische Soldaten konnen nicht evakuiert werden, da der einzige Zugang zum Meer, eine strategisch wichtige Meerespassage von zwei riesigen Kanonen der Deutschen uberwacht wird. Die Bombardierungsversuche der Briten sind fehlgeschlagen und nur ein eilig zusammengestelltes Kommandounternehmen scheint einen Ausweg aus der aussichtslosen Lage zu bieten. Es besteht aus Freiwilligen, alle kriegserfahren und kampferprobt: zum Beispiel Captain Mallory, ein neuseelandischer Bergsteiger, der britische Sprengstoffexperte Miller, oder etwa der griechische Offizier Stavros.

Der Plan sieht vor, die schwerbewachte Insel Navarone bei Nacht und Nebel in einem alten Fischerboot im Schutz der turkischen Kuste uber die als unerklimmbar geltende Felsenseite im Suden zu erreichen.  Unterstutzt durch einheimische Widerstandskampfer soll sich das Kommando dann bis in die Festung durchschlagen und diese in die Luft sprengen, wobei man davon ausgeht, dass die Kanonen dadurch zerstort werden.

<sub-title>Sierra Nevada und Tabernas-Wuste</sub-title>
<desc>Etliche Gipfel in der Sierra Nevada sind mehr als 3000 Meter hoch. Fruher gab es hier Dutzende Gletscher, die zu den sudlichsten in Europa gehorten. Der letzte Gletscher der Region, der Valeta-Gletscher, verschwand 1913. Um die Vergangenheit der Sierra Nevada besser zu verstehen, untersuchen Wissenschaftler deren Gesteinsformationen. Vor allem aber mochten sie sich ein Bild von der Zukunft des Gebirges machen. Es befindet sich in einem ca. 170.000 Hektar groSSen Gebiet, teilweise geschutzt als National- und Naturpark, in dem Schneelandschaften und trockene Steppen im Kontrast zueinander stehen. In der ersten Fruhlingssonne bietet eine widerstandsfahige endemische Flora ein buntes Schauspiel aus smaragd-, elfenbein- und turkisfarbenen Schattierungen. Spaniens hochstgelegene Dorfer in der Bergregion Las Alpujarras tragen die Spuren verschiedener Zivilisationen; besonders die Mauren pragten dieses Gebiet und hinterlieSSen ein reiches Erbe. Nicht weit davon entfernt liegt die Wuste von Tabernas. Ihre im Laufe der Zeit geformten Canyons und Badlands zeugen von der geologischen Geschichte dieser Landschaft, die bis vor etwa acht Millionen Jahren vom Meer bedeckt war. Einst war diese Wuste der Schauplatz von Duellen, spater wurden hier die beruhmten Italo-Western gedreht. Doch aufgrund der starken Erosion verandern sich die kargen Landschaften bestandig. Ein Prozess, den der Klimawandel weiter beschleunigt. Der Dokumentarfilm lasst die beiden kontrastierenden Welten miteinander in Zwiesprache treten. Die fragile Schonheit, aber auch die Widerstandsfahigkeit unseres Planeten laden dazu ein, uber die Rolle des Menschen als Teil der Natur nachzudenken.</desc>

<sub-title>Sakurajima: Unter der Asche des Riesen</sub-title>
<desc>Der japanische Vulkan Sakurajima ist fast taglich aktiv und stellt eine akute Gefahr fur die 600.000 in seinem Radius lebenden Menschen dar. Das wohl eindrucklichste Beispiel fur die Bedrohung zeigte sich 1914: Eine gigantische Aschewolke stieg aus dem Krater, enorme Lavamassen ergossen sich uber die Flanken des Vulkans - die groSSte Vulkankatastrophe Japans im 20. Jahrhundert. Doch aufgrund der hohen Bevolkerungsdichte und des Vulkanreichtums hatten die Japaner gar keine andere Wahl, als auch Zonen in der Nahe solcher Feuerriesen zu besiedeln. Jeden Tag treten die Dorfbewohner zum GroSSputz auf die StraSSe, da der Vulkan Unmengen an Asche ausstoSSt - im Jahr bis zu 30 Tonnen. Das ist zwar lastig, bringt aber auch Vorteile: Die Vulkanasche dungt den Boden, so dass an den Hangen des Sakurajima die groSSten Rettiche der Welt wachsen. Aufgrund der standigen Aktivitat ist der Krater nicht zuganglich, doch die Forscher brauchen Informationen, um Eruptionen vorauszusehen. Arnaud trifft Masato Iguchi, der ihm eine weltweit einmalige Methode prasentiert: Um dem Zentrum des Geschehens so nahe wie moglich zu kommen, wurde ein Tunnel zum Inneren des Vulkans gebaut. So konnen die Bewegungen des Magmas praktisch vor Ort beobachtet werden. Im Falle einer groSSeren Eruption mussen jedoch Tausende Menschen in Rekordzeit in Sicherheit gebracht werden, deswegen finden jahrliche Evakuierungsubungen statt - ein Ernstfalltraining, das enorme logistische und menschliche Ressourcen erfordert. Trotz der groSSen Gefahren haben die Menschen es geschafft, sich mit dem turbulenten Sakurajima zu arrangieren. Sie leben ihr Leben - den rauchenden Vulkankrater stets im Blick.</desc>

<sub-title>Die philippinischen Schokoladenhugel</sub-title>
<desc>Im Herzen des philippinischen Archipels erheben sich auf der Insel Bohol 1268 majestatische kakaobraune Hugel, die Chocolate Hills, auch Schokoladenhugel genannt. Sie bilden eine der schonsten Landschaften der Erde, die seit 2006 zum UNESCO-Welterbe zahlt. Die Insel wurde erst vor zwei Millionen Jahren vom asiatischen Kontinent abgetrennt und beherbergt eine einzigartige Flora und Fauna. Im Untergrund der Insel liegen uber 1400 Hohlen, in denen 35 Fledertierarten leben. Bohol beheimatet aber nicht nur das groSSte Fledertier der Welt (den Goldkronen-Flughund), sondern auch den kleinsten Primaten (den Philippinen-Koboldmaki), einen Riesengleiter (den Philippinen-Gleitflieger) sowie hunderte Vogel- und Affenarten. Der jadegrune Fluss Loboc schlangelt sich durch die jahrhundertealten Walder und mundet schlieSSlich ins Meer. Die nahrstoffreichen Gewasser versorgen dabei die Tiere und Pflanzen der Mangrovenwalder und Korallenriffe. Im Meer vor Bohol lebt eine Vielzahl von Schildkroten-, Wasserschlangen-, Fisch- und Haiarten, wie beispielsweise der Fuchshai. Mittlerweile wird das fragile √ñkosystem Bohols allerdings durch Entwaldung, Dynamitfischerei und landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken bedroht, die immer starker in den Lebensraum der Tiere eingreifen.</desc>

<sub-title>Estland und das kleine Konigreich der Seto</sub-title>
<desc>Es ist eines der kleinsten Volker Europas: Die ethnische Minderheit der Seto lebt im Suden des heutigen Estland, ihr traditionelles Siedlungsgebiet reicht bis uber die nahe Grenze hinein ins westliche Russland. Nur noch einige Tausend von ihnen gibt es heute, mit ganz eigener Kultur. Einer ihrer wichtigsten Brauche ist die alljahrliche Wahl des "Vizekonigs". Er vertritt ihren Konig "Peko" auf Erden, einen legendenumwobenen, heidnischen Gott. Zwar sind die Seto schon seit Jahrhunderten auch streng glaubige orthodoxe Christen, aber "Peko" und sein irdischer Stellvertreter genieSSen nach wie vor hochstes Ansehen. Rein Jarvelill ist seit einem Jahr der Vizekonig. Wird er die Wahl auch diesmal wiedergewinnen?</desc>

<sub-title>Toulouse-Lautrec / Australien / Marokkos Sultan</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Toulouse-Lautrec und das Pariser Nachtleben Auf der Buhne des Pariser Varietetheaters Moulin Rouge werden junge, schone und unversehrte Korper zur Schau gestellt. Ein Kunstler zeichnete sie einst pausenlos, um seine eigene Behinderung zu vergessen: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec malte, was ihm selbst durch seine schwere Knochenerkrankung verwehrt blieb. Sein einzigartiger Pinselstrich und sein Blick fur das Besondere verewigten das feierlustige Paris zu Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts auf Plakaten und Gemalden. (2): In Australien: Wie ein Bumerang Das L-formige Wurfobjekt fasziniert jeden, der es in die Hande nimmt. Ein Bumerang ist weit mehr als ein Spielzeug: Er symbolisiert sowohl die Tradition der australischen Ureinwohner als auch die Aneignung des Landes durch die WeiSSen. Wer sich zum Bumerang bekennt, zeigt seine Angehorigkeit zum australischen Volk. (3): In Taiwan: Huhnchensuppe mit wildem Pfeffer von Tapas Im einsamen Bergdorf Lixing bereitet Tapas ein traditionelles Gericht zu. Ihr Nachbar zerlegt ein Huhnchen fur sie, das sie in kochendes Wasser taucht: Krallen, Kopf, Flugel - das ganze Huhn landet im Kochtopf. Mit Ingwer und wildem Pfeffer verfeinert kochelt die Suppe. Serviert wird sie mit gestampften Klebreis. (4): Marokkos unbarmherziger Sultan Die Kaiserstadt Mekn√®s ist seit dem 17. Jahrhundert fur ihre Palaste und Mauern beruhmt.

<sub-title>Maylis de Kerangal in Marseille / Indien / Tasmanien</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Toskana: Heimat von Pinocchio Pinocchio ist das Geschopf von Meister Geppetto - und der bitterbosen Vorstellungswelt des toskanischen Schriftstellers Carlo Collodi (1826-1890). Sein 1883 erschienenes Buch hat mit der Filmversion von Walt Disney aus dem Jahr 1940 nur wenig gemein, denn anders als die frohliche Zeichentrickmarionette, die sich lieber amusiert anstatt zur Schule zu gehen, erwacht Collodis Pinocchio in einer grausamen Gesellschaft zum Leben, in der Ungerechtigkeit und Elend herrschen. Dank ihrer universellen Botschaft zahlt die Coming-of-Age-Story, die in mehr als 200 Sprachen ubersetzt wurde, zu den meistverkauften italienischen Buchern der Welt. (2): New York: Im Kreuzfeuer der Graffiti-Sprayer Graffiti kann vieles sein: ein dekorativer Farbtupfer im tristen GroSSstadtgrau, der Wunsch, sich an einer Mauer zu verewigen, oder auch ein Ausdruck des Protests gegen Ungerechtigkeiten. Was in New York einst als vandaischer Auswuchs einer orientierungslosen Jugend abgetan wurde, hat sich uber die Jahre zu einer eigenstandigen Kunstdisziplin entwickelt. Wahrend Graffiti fruher fur Gewalt und Elend stand, genieSSt es heute ein hohes Ansehen und gilt als ein Symbol der Gentrifizierung, die in New Yorks ehemaligen Arbeitervierteln Einzug gehalten hat. (3): Kolumbien: Angelas Garnelen in Kokossauce Im Herzen von Bogot√° serviert Angela eine Spezialitat von der ecuadorianischen Kuste: Encocado. Das Gericht wird traditionell mit Fisch zubereitet, doch Angela bevorzugt Garnelen, die sie in einer SoSSe aus Kokosmilch, Knoblauch und Paprika schmort. Dazu reicht sie Kochbananenfladen und Reis. (4): Bretagne: Ein Dorf schreibt Fernsehgeschichte 1962 verfolgten die Bewohner des bretonischen Dorfes Pleumeur-Bodou staunend, wie vor ihren Augen eine riesige weiSSe Kugel 50 Meter in die Hohe wuchs. Was hier vor sich ging, war keine Science-Fiction, sondern Wissenschaft: Mitten im Kalten Krieg wollten die USA hier ein revolutionares Verfahren zur weltweiten Signalubertragung testen ...</desc>

<sub-title>Unzen: Der Gefahr zum Trotz</sub-title>
<desc>200 Jahre lang schlummerte der Unzen im auSSersten Sudwesten Japans, bevor er sich 1991 nachdrucklich zuruckmeldete. In den folgenden funf Jahren spuckte er uber 10.000 pyroklastische Strome aus, die immense Schaden verursachten. Die 400 Grad heiSSen Lawinen aus Gas und vulkanischer Asche rasten zusammen mit Lavabrocken die Vulkanhange hinunter und vernichteten alles im Umkreis von mehreren Kilometern. Doch mit dem Ende der Eruptionen war die Gefahr noch nicht gebannt: Die Ausbruche hinterlieSSen uber 200 Millionen Tonnen vulkanisches Material, das bei heftigen Regenfallen noch immer mitgerissen wird. Daraus konnen Schlammstrome, sogenannte Lahars, entstehen, die sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit von bis zu 100 Stundenkilometer ihren Weg ins Tal walzen. Doch statt zu resignieren, bieten die Japaner dem aggressiven Vulkan die Stirn. Nach dem letzten Ausbruch veranlassten die Behorden den Bau eines Dammsystems. Bis heute dauern die Arbeiten an, denn es ist keine gewohnliche Baustelle: Das komplette Gebiet ist Gefahrenzone - Zutritt strengstens verboten. Der Baustellenleiter, Herr Matsui, zeigt Arnaud, wie dort gearbeitet werden kann, ohne dass ein Mensch die Baustelle betritt. Wie in einem Videospiel werden die Baumaschinen aus sicherem Abstand via Fernbedienung gesteuert - in dieser GroSSenordnung eine einzigartige Technik. Trotz allem ist die Sicherheit in dem Gebiet keineswegs garantiert - doch die Menschen haben gelernt die unvorhersehbaren Launen der Natur als Bestandteil ihres Alltags zu akzeptieren. Auch wenn der Unzen noch so tobt - die Menschen zu seinen FuSSen werden nicht weichen.</desc>

<title>Stille Helden in den Drogenvierteln von Marseille</title>
<desc>Der Alltag in den "Quartiers Nord" von Marseille ist gepragt vom Drogenhandel und von Bandenkriegen mit Dutzenden Toten. Der franzosische Staat bekommt die Situation seit Jahren nicht unter Kontrolle, die Folge sind Zukunftsangste und Hoffnungslosigkeit. Diesen Zustand will Amine Kessaci verandern. Der 21-Jahrige ist Grunder des Vereins Conscience. Vor Ort und in der Stadtpolitik setzt sich der Verein fur bessere Lebensbedingungen in den Vierteln ein und unterstutzt Familien, die - wie seine eigene - Angehorige im Bandenkrieg der Drogendealer verloren haben. Ein Lichtblick in den Sozialbauvierteln ist ein umgebauter Feuerwehrbus, der medizinische Hilfe bringt. Der Allgemeinmediziner Slim Hadiji und sein Team bieten Gesundheitsvorsorge und Informationsveranstaltungen an, aber auch Hausbesuche und die Begleitung zu Arztterminen. Sie kummern sich um Menschen, die sonst kaum oder keine Hilfe erreicht. Eine wichtige Anlaufstelle und ein sicherer Ort fur Kinder und Jugendliche der Problemviertel ist der FuSSballverein FCL Malpasse.

Um jegliche Widerstandsversuche zu unterdrucken, verhaftete und verschleppte die Geheimpolizei 1941 zehntausende Litauer in sibirische Arbeitslager. Die "Feinde des Volkes" wurden mit ihren Frauen und Kindern abtransportiert. Die litauische Schriftstellerin Jurga Vilƒó erzahlt ihre Geschichte in der Graphic Novel Sibiro Haiku. Sie beschreibt darin den langen Weg der Angst, des Hungers und der Trennung aus der Perspektive ihres Vaters, damals ein Kind. (2): Telenovelas: Eine brasilianische Leidenschaft Jeden Abend begeistern sich in Brasilien Millionen fur ihr Lieblingsprogramm: die Telenovela. Dreiecksbeziehungen, Eifersucht, Verrat, Geheimnisse, Spannung und uberraschende Wendungen - die Serien triefen vor Klischees. Der besondere Reiz dieser Mischung aus Latino-Drama, Erfolgstraum und taglichem Leben ruhrt von den AuSSendrehs und einem gesellschaftlichen Aktualitatsbezug.

Hier lebt die Schriftstellerin, die 1969 geboren wurde, seit 2020 auch mit ihrer Partnerin, der Philosophin Beatriz Preciado. In ihrem 2010 veroffentlichten Kriminalroman  ∫Apokalypse Baby ∫ lasst Despentes kein gutes Haar an der Heteronormativitat. Sie entfuhrt ihre Leser in die rebellische Welt der katalanischen Randgruppen, der feministischen sexpositiven Milieus, der AuSSenseiter und der extremen Gewalt. (2): Metal, Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks Finnland ist eine Hochburg des Metal. Schatzungen zufolge kommen etwa 53 Metal-Bands auf 100.000 Einwohner, insgesamt fast 3.000 im ganzen Land. Die energiegeladene Musikrichtung zehrt von den kulturellen Wurzeln des beschaulichen nordischen Landes und hat sich zum Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks entwickelt. In den 1980er-Jahren traf der im Vereinigten Konigreich entstandene Metal auf ein Finnland, das von seinen sowjetischen Nachbarn nicht nur politisch isoliert gehalten wurde. Nach dem Fall der Sowjetunion sturzten sich die Finnen regelrecht auf diese Musik, die die Erinnerung an ihre Legenden und Mythen wachhalt.

Um seiner Drohung Nachdruck zu verleihen, sprengt er bereits eine der Bomben. Die britische Regierung weigert sich, auf die Erpressung einzugehen, und ein Team von Sprengstoffexperten unter der Leitung von Lieutenant Anthony Fallon wird auf das Schiff entsandt, um die Sprengsatze zu entscharfen. Doch bereits die √úberfahrt auf dem sturmgepeitschten Atlantik fordert erste Opfer. Die Zunder der Bomben erweisen sich als kompliziert - bei jeder falschen Bewegung droht eine Explosion. Wahrend Fallon und sein Team einen verzweifelten Kampf gegen die Zeit fuhren, ubernimmt Scotland Yard die Ermittlungen an Land.

<sub-title>Kongo: Schutz fur den Gorillawald</sub-title>
<desc>In den riesigen Regenwaldern im Norden der Republik Kongo geschieht etwas AuSSergewohnliches: Hier arbeiten Holzfaller, die den Wald nicht zerstoren, sondern durch ihre Arbeit zum Erhalt der Tropenwalder und ihrer Artenvielfalt beitragen. Dieses kleine Wunder gelingt, weil sich zwei Holzfirmen verpflichtet haben, in ihren Waldern eine nachhaltige Forstwirtschaft zu betreiben - immerhin auf einer Flache halb so groSS wie die Schweiz. Noch nicht mal ein Baum pro Hektar wird dort gefallt. Besonders artenreiche Zonen bleiben sogar vollstandig von den Kettensagen der Holzfaller verschont. Mehr als ein Viertel der gesamten Waldflache steht daher unter Schutz. Diese selektive Holznutzung hilft der Tierwelt: 70.000 Gorillas leben allein im Wald des Holzunternehmens IFO ‚Äî mehr als irgendwo sonst. Ihre Bestande bleiben seit Jahren stabil. Fur die Holzfirmen zahlt sich der schonende Umgang mit der Natur aus, denn die Walder erholen sich vom Holzeinschlag und konnen auch in Zukunft genutzt werden. Auch die Menschen in einer der armsten Regionen Zentralafrikas profitieren. Die Holzindustrie schafft dringend benotigte Arbeitsplatze, sorgt fur sauberes Trinkwasser und eine Gesundheitsversorgung.

<sub-title>Schweiz: Einsatz fur die Alpenwiesen</sub-title>
<desc>Die Schweizer Alpen sind eine der grandiosesten Landschaften der Welt. Es gibt hier eine enorme Vielfalt an Tier- und Pflanzenarten. Neben Gamsen und Murmeltieren findet man seltene Pflanzen wie EdelweiSS und Enzian. Im Sommer verwandeln sich die Almen in ein buntes Blumenmeer. Fur viele ist diese Bergwelt "Natur pur". Doch dieses Almwiesenparadies stammt aus Menschenhand. Nur weil Bergbauern seit Jahrhunderten ihr Vieh in die Berge treiben, konnte dieses besondere Mosaik aus Wiesen, Waldern und Felsen entstehen. Ohne Beweidung wurden die Wiesen in wenigen Jahrzehnten von Gebusch und Wald uberwuchert werden. Pflanzen, Insekten und Vogelarten wurden verschwinden, Natur und Urlaubslandschaft gingen verloren. Und genau diese Entwicklung droht. Das Leben der Bergbauern ist hart, viele geben ihre Hofe auf. Andere bleiben, treiben aber die Tiere im Sommer nicht mehr auf die Alm. Der Wald dringt immer weiter vor. Doch die Schweizer haben die Gefahr erkannt und lassen sich einiges einfallen, um ihre zauberhafte Bergwelt zu erhalten. Der Film begleitet die Hirtin Lean, die mit 900 Schafen den Sommer hoch oben in den Bergen so verbringt wie Schafer vor Hunderten von Jahren. Er zeigt, was die Schweizer alles tun, um ihre alten Traditionen zu erhalten. Staatliche Fordergelder fur die Almbauern gehoren genauso dazu wie die Wolle der Schweizer Schafe, die seit einigen Jahren wieder vermarktet wird. Es geht darum, neue Wege zu finden, um die einzigartige Landschaft der Schweizer Alpen auch in Zukunft zu erhalten.</desc>

Ein Konzept, das noch heute das tagliche Leben der Menschen im modernen China beeinflusst und auch weltweit enorm popular geworden ist. Grun ist die Farbe des Holz-Elements, es steht fur den Osten, Kindheit, Vitalitat und den Fruhling. An den Hangen der Dongting-Berge ist der Fruhling die wichtigste Zeit des Jahres. Das milde Klima hier im Osten des Landes nahe Shanghai ist ideal fur einen beruhmten grunen Tee: Biluochun. Die besten Blatter landen in den Lehmofen des Teemeisters Yan Jielong - aber erst das Zusammenspiel aller funf Elemente macht den Tee perfekt: In Erde gewachsen und vom Wasser genahrt, wird der Tee geerntet - Holz wird fur das Feuer benotigt, in einer Metallpfanne wird der Tee gerostet, wodurch sich der Kreis schlieSSt. Grun ist die Farbe des Neubeginns in China. Wahrend Tee im Fruhjahr geerntet wird, wird eine andere Nutzpflanze in dieser Zeit ausgesat: Reis. Auf den Terrassen im Suden der Provinz Yunnan bestellt das Volk der Hani mit Wasserbuffeln die Felder fur die Aussaat - so wie seit hunderten von Jahren. Ein stetiger Kreislauf. Alles im Universum kommt, wandelt sich, vergeht und beginnt von Neuem. WuXing, die Lehre der funf Phasen, Elemente und Farben reicht Jahrtausende zuruck. Doch sie ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor.

<sub-title>Rot - Vom Neujahrsfest und dem Feuer des Sudens</sub-title>
<desc>"Kreislauf der funf Elemente" - so wird eine chinesische Lehre genannt, die den Kreislauf der Natur und des Lebens beschreibt. Darin gibt es funf Phasen, jede davon ist mit einer Farbe verbunden. Grun ist das Holz-Element, was fur den Neubeginn nach dem Winter steht. Das Feuer-Element ist Rot, es steht fur die Hitze, den Sommer, die dynamische Kraft der Jugend und Feierlichkeiten. Einst wurde alles rot geschmuckt, wenn der Kaiser eine Opferzeremonie abhielt. Rot wie das Blut. Heute ist Rot zur Farbe der Freude und des Glucks geworden. Bei Familie Cheng in der historischen Kleinstad Pingyao laufen die Vorbereitungen fur das Neujahrsfest mit Hochdruck.

Mit etwas roter Deko werden daraus Glucksbrotchen fur die ganze Familie - das neue Jahr kann beginnen. Auch in der chinesischen Kuche haben Farben eine groSSe Bedeutung: Rote Nahrung gilt z.B. als gut fur Herz und Dunndarm. Besonders beliebt sind rote Chilischoten. China stellt die Halfte der Weltproduktion an Chili her. Die Schoten trocknen in kilometerlagen Reihen in der Wuste am FuSSe des Tianshan Gebirges. Oft fahren Koche und Kochinnen mit Kleinlastern direkt zu den Trockenfelder, um sich sackeweise Chilis aufzuladen Durch die Lehre der funf Elemente hat die Bedeutung der Farben in nahezu alle Lebensbereiche in China Einzug gehalten.</desc>

<title>Super-Ager - Geistig fit im hohen Alter</title>
<desc>Hans-Joachim Petzke ist ein Phanomen, denn mit seinen 84 Jahren ist er anders als viele Gleichaltrige noch topfit, korperlich und geistig. Jeden Tag steht er zwischen funf und halb sechs Uhr auf, er treibt wochentlich Sport und lernt sogar noch eine neue Sprache. Doch Hans-Joachim Petzke ist kein gewohnlicher Rentner: Er ist einer der sogenannten Super-Ager, deren Geheimnis am Deutschen Zentrum fur Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen in Magdeburg erforscht wird. Auf der Suche nach Menschen wie Petzke untersucht das Team um Studienleiterin Dr. Anne Maass und Beate Schumann-Werner hunderte von Probanden ab dem 60. Lebensjahr. Ob jemand wirklich ein Super-Ager ist, wird vor allem mit kognitiven Tests ermittelt. Die 86-jahrige Gisela Opitz hat sich als Studienteilnehmerin gemeldet. Sie arbeitet taglich daran, ihr Gehirn fit zu halten. Als Ehrenamtliche fuhrt sie Besuchergruppen durch den Magdeburger Dom ‚Äì und versucht, jede noch so komplexe Frage zu beantworten. Sie ist sich sicher: "Das trainiert mein Gehirn und so rostet es nicht ein". Doch ist auch sie eine Super-Agerin? Wahrend viele Menschen sich fragen, wie lange sie zukunftig arbeiten werden oder 60-Jahrige bereits vom Vorruhestand traumen, sind andere im hohen Alter sogar noch berufstatig. Doch wann ist es ratsam, altersbedingt kurzer zu treten? Walter Spielkamp aus Stuttgart ist 82 Jahre alt und Statiker. Er wird bei neuen Bauprojekten zurate gezogen und ist unter anderem fur ihre Standsicherheit zustandig. Eine Aufgabe, die nicht nur einen wachen Geist, sondern auch viel Verantwortung voraussetzt.</desc>

<title>Jetset - Die goldene √Ñra der Luftfahrt</title>
<desc>Lange vor Klimakrise und Flugscham gilt das Fliegen als Inbegriff von Luxus, Freiheit und Weltoffenheit. Seit den 1950er-Jahren erlebt die Luftfahrt einen epochalen Wandel. Technologische Meisterleistungen wie die Lockheed Super Constellation setzen neue MaSSstabe fur Geschwindigkeit und Komfort. Internationale Reisen werden schneller, luxurioser und die Ziele exotischer. Fliegen wird zum Symbol fur Glamour, Piloten und Stewardessen zu Helden des Himmels. Edeltraud Lioba Miller, ehemalige Stewardess bei Pan Am, erinnert sich: "Pan Am war der Inbegriff von Glanz und Glamour. Bei uns war der Jet Set zu Hause." Die Stewardess wird zum Aushangeschild der Airlines, ihre Uniformen zum Symbol der √Ñra. Heute London, morgen Paris, ubermorgen New York - das Leben der "Jetsetter". Die Concorde verkorpert den Hohepunkt dieser √Ñra. Sie uberquert den Atlantik in nur dreieinhalb Stunden und definiert Eleganz und Exklusivitat neu. Jean Louis Chatelain, Concorde-Pilot, beschreibt sie als "technisches Wunder". An Bord genieSSen Passagiere Champagner, Kaviar und edelste Weine. Nicole Meneveux, ehemalige Concorde-Stewardess, schwarmt: "Concorde war ein Drei-Sterne-Restaurant bei doppelter Schallgeschwindigkeit." Doch in den 1980er-Jahren endet die √Ñra des exklusiven High-Society-Privileges. GroSSraum-Jets wie die Boeing 747 machen das Fliegen massentauglich und Tickets erschwinglicher. Die Faszination einer √Ñra, die die Welt und den Himmel veranderte, lebt nur als Erinnerung weiter. Der Glamour ist verschwunden, nun wird der rasant wachsende Luftverkehr zur Herausforderung fur die Zukunft.</desc>

<title>Die Concorde - Absturz einer Legende</title>
<desc>Die Concorde war das auSSergewohnlichste Passagierflugzeug, das je gebaut wurde - ein technisches Wunderwerk. 30 Jahre lang donnerte sie mit der Geschwindigkeit einer Gewehrkugel uber den Atlantik: Die Concorde uberholte die Uhrzeit und kam fruher in New York an, als sie in Paris oder London abgeflogen war. Nur wenige konnten sich doppelte Schallgeschwindigkeit leisten: Geschaftsleute, Popstars und Luxusurlauber, denen es auf 10.000 Dollar nicht ankam.Die Katastrophe geschah am 25. Juli 2000 und wirft bis heute Fragen auf. 113 Menschen kamen dabei ums Leben. Nur wenige wissen, dass am Schicksalstag der Concorde zwei Flugzeuge von Paris aus nach New York starteten, weil es so viele Passagiere gab, die in New York eine Kreuzfahrt beginnen wollten. Die Reisegruppen konnten vorab zwischen den Concorde-Maschinen wechseln und umbuchen, was einige um ihr Leben brachte, wahrend andere ihres durch die Umbuchung retten konnten.Ein Hobbyfilmer filmte den ersten Flug. Er hatte seine Platze kurzfristig getauscht. Kurz nachdem seine Concorde in New York gelandet war, flog die zweite mit seinen Tauschpartnern in Paris los. Nur 133 Sekunden nach dem Start endete ihr Flug in der Katastrophe.Die Filmdokumentation erzahlt die wechselvolle Geschichte der Supersonic-Projekte und lasst auch die Konkurrenz nicht aus: Die Moskauer TU-144, auch "Konkordski" genannt, erlitt ein noch fruheres Ende als die Concorde.Langst gibt es Plane fur einen neuen √úberschall-Jet fur Passagiere. Die ersten Prototypen sollen noch im Jahr 2020 starten, bis die Serienproduktion beginnen kann, wird es noch dauern.</desc>

Als Nora Damtoft ihn ausfindig macht und zur Rede stellt, beteuert er seine Unschuld. Doch Nora bleibt uberzeugt, dass er etwas verheimlicht, und beschlieSSt, ihre Erkenntnisse offentlich zu machen.

<title>Wien feiert Beethoven</title>
<sub-title>Philippe Jourdan und die Wiener Symphoniker</sub-title>
<desc>Der 22. Dezember 1808 ist in die Musikgeschichte eingegangen, denn an diesem Tag wurde im Theater an der Wien unter dem Titel "GroSSe Akademie", ein gigantisches Konzert gegeben, das gleich vier Welturauffuhrungen von Werken Ludwig van Beethovens enthielt: die Sinfonie Nr. 5 c-Moll op. 67, die Sinfonie Nr. 6 F-Dur op. 68 "Pastorale", das Konzert fur Klavier und Orchester Nr. 4 G-Dur op. 58 und die Fantasie fur Klavier, Chor und Orchester c-Moll op. 80 "Chorfantasie". AuSSerdem standen folgende Beethoven-Stucke auf dem Programm: die Fantasie fur Klavier op. 77, die Szene und Arie fur Sopran und Orchester op. 65 "Ah perfido!" sowie zwei Satze aus der Messe C-Dur op. 86 fur Soli, Chor und Orchester: II. Gloria (Qui tollis - Quoniam) und IV. Sanctus (Benedictus - Osanna). Philippe Jordan, der gegenwartige Chefdirigent der Wiener Symphoniker, hat dieses historische Konzert in voller Lange rekonstruiert. Unterstutzt wird er von der Wiener Singakademie und Solisten wie Jacquelyn Wagner (Sopran), Miriam Kutrowatz (Sopran), Anke Vondung (Alt), Allan Clayton (Tenor), Franz Gurtelschmied (Tenor) und Hanno Muller-Brachmann (Bassbariton).

<sub-title>Norwegen: Ruckkehr zu den Enteninseln</sub-title>
<desc>Im Vega-Archipel, hoch im Norden Norwegens am Polarkreis, ist die Natur karg. Die Menschen lebten hier jahrhundertlang als Fischer und Bauern und sind mit wilden Eiderenten eine einmalige Partnerschaft eingegangen. Der Vega-Archipel mit seinen uber 6.000 Inseln ist das Reich der Eiderenten. Sie kommen jedes Jahr hierhin, um in den flachen Gewassern Nahrung zu finden und sich zu paaren. Doch auf den kahlen Inseln sind ihre Eier und Kuken auch immer dem Wetter und Fressfeinden wie Mowen und Adlern ausgesetzt. Die Inselbewohner bieten den Enten einen einmaligen Schutz: Schon seit Hunderten von Jahren bauen sie unzahlige Verschlage aus Treibholz, kleine Hauser aus Stein und Nistplatze unter ihren Wohnhausern. Dort konnen die Vogel sicher bruten. Als Gegenleistung ernten die Menschen am Ende der Brutsaison die kostbaren Eiderdaunen, mit denen die Enten ihre Nester ausgepolstert haben. Die Federn sind wegen ihrer extrem hohen Isolationskraft und der groSSen Haltbarkeit ein begehrter Rohstoff. Um eine Daunendecke zu fullen, die dann fur mehrere Tausend Euro verkauft wird, braucht es Daunen aus 60 bis 70 Nestern. Diese Lebensweise, die auch die Natur der Inseln gepragt hat, ist in Gefahr. Denn das Leben im Archipel ist einsam und hart. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten haben die meisten Bewohner die Inseln verlassen. Nur noch wenige von Ihnen kummern sich im Sommer um die Enten. Doch es gibt Hoffnung: Seit 2004 ist Vega wegen der einmaligen Symbiose von Mensch und Tier UNESCO-Welterbe - und eine neue Generation junger Norweger engagiert sich im Archipel.</desc>

<desc>On the last leg of his South Korean adventure, Alexander Armstrong heads to the bustling port of Busan, where South Koreas biggest fish market is to be found. Alexander gets to try some of the weirdest seafood youve ever seen, fresh from the sea, including a couple of sea creatures that are so fresh theyre still moving as he bites into them. The area around Busan is home to a delicious, nutritious and slightly boozy rice wine drink called makgeolli and, after the full-on intensity of modern Seoul, Alexander is delighted to meet a famous brewer who uses an ancient recipe for makgeolli, the basis of which are strange cakes of wheat made by hand or, more precisely, by foot. Hopping 180 miles across the Korea Strait from Busan, Alexander finds himself on South Koreas largest island Jeju, where Alexander meets a famous dyer of cloth who uses only the juice of the persimmon fruit and sunlight to create gorgeous textiles. Jeju is a place where ancient beliefs are still practised by a ritual priest, or shaman, to help people with physical and mental problems. Its a pretty gruelling business being treated by a shaman, but our adventurer has been suffering from insomnia and nows the time to see if the spirit world can help. After an exhilarating climb up the extinct volcano known as Sunrise Peak, the intrepid Mr Armstrong has an appointment to meet the endangered but not at all cuddly Jeju wild dog. By this point, Alexander is so hungry he could eat a horse. So he does, in Jejus premier horsemeat restaurant. Most of it is raw, but hes up to the job, before he finds out what has happened to the puppies of the Jeju wild dogs that would have happily eaten him earlier on.</desc>

<desc>Ben Fogle explores and follows the same path that various individuals have walked. Having willingly forsaken the luxuries and lifestyle that the modern world has to offer, Ben Fogle explores the less-than-ordinary life that people have swapped to in the wilderness. Many of these destinations are primarily "off the grid" in some of the most remote locations on earth, including Georgia Swamplands USA, Swedish Arctic Circle, Wilderness Island Australia and the Sahara Desert. Men, either alone or with a family, sacrifice the comforts and almost any social life to experience the hardships, challenges and rewards of a life that is constantly challenged by nature and be at one with nature. Being largely dependant on their own abilities, Ben Fogle experiences their way of living for a week to understand the reasons behind why they chose this new way of living. Released on Channel 5 in the UK, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild was produced by Motion Content Group and Renegade Pictures.</desc>

<sub-title>Panama</sub-title>
<desc>As always, Ben joins a variety of brave folks who chose to venture down a very alternative path to everyday life. The aim is to discover the reality of leaving it all behind, and meet those who have chosen to ditch a life dominated by debts and the daily grind to go in search of something different. This week, Ben ventures to Central America and a remote island off the coast of Panama. His host Jaimie is an inventor who has built a unique home and an unconventional family, to create his own wild utopia. Ben gets stuck into island life, from scrubbing boat hulls and hacking through vegetation, to pedalo exercising and home schooling. He questions the unusual family dynamics in this house, and joins his eccentric host to sample his inventions‚Äîfrom a fart machine to cook on, to a computer game based on his life.</desc>

<title>L√µuna-Korea koos Alexander Armstrongiga</title>
<desc>On the last leg of his South Korean adventure, Alexander Armstrong heads to the bustling port of Busan, where South Koreas biggest fish market is to be found. Alexander gets to try some of the weirdest seafood youve ever seen, fresh from the sea, including a couple of sea creatures that are so fresh theyre still moving as he bites into them. The area around Busan is home to a delicious, nutritious and slightly boozy rice wine drink called makgeolli and, after the full-on intensity of modern Seoul, Alexander is delighted to meet a famous brewer who uses an ancient recipe for makgeolli, the basis of which are strange cakes of wheat made by hand or, more precisely, by foot. Hopping 180 miles across the Korea Strait from Busan, Alexander finds himself on South Koreas largest island Jeju, where Alexander meets a famous dyer of cloth who uses only the juice of the persimmon fruit and sunlight to create gorgeous textiles. Jeju is a place where ancient beliefs are still practised by a ritual priest, or shaman, to help people with physical and mental problems. Its a pretty gruelling business being treated by a shaman, but our adventurer has been suffering from insomnia and nows the time to see if the spirit world can help. After an exhilarating climb up the extinct volcano known as Sunrise Peak, the intrepid Mr Armstrong has an appointment to meet the endangered but not at all cuddly Jeju wild dog. By this point, Alexander is so hungry he could eat a horse. So he does, in Jejus premier horsemeat restaurant. Most of it is raw, but hes up to the job, before he finds out what has happened to the puppies of the Jeju wild dogs that would have happily eaten him earlier on.</desc>

<title>Wonders of the Solar System</title>
<sub-title>Dead or Alive</sub-title>
<desc>Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on Earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system. The worlds that surround our planet are all made of rock, but there the similarity ends. Some have a beating geological heart, others are frozen in time. Brian travels to the tallest mountain on Earth, the volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii, to show how something as basic as a planets size can make the difference between life and death. Even on the summit of this volcano, Brian would stand in the shade of the tallest mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on Mars called Olympus Mons, which rises up 27 km. Yet the fifth wonder in the series isnt on a planet at all. Its on a tiny moon of Jupiter. The discoveries made on Io have been astonishing. This fragment of rock should be cold and dead, yet, with the volcanic landscape of eastern Ethiopia as a backdrop, Brian reveals why Io is home to extraordinary lakes of lava and giant volcanic plumes that erupt 500 km into the sky.</desc>

<title>Inside the Factory</title>
<sub-title>Crisps</sub-title>
<desc>Documentary series. Gregg Wallace follows 27 tonnes of potatoes from a farm in Hampshire through the largest crisp factory on earth, as they are peeled, sliced and fried to make more than five million packets of crisps every 24 hours. Once the crisps are flavoured, they are put into bags in a room with over 100 machines that can fill hundreds of thousands of bags every hour. Greg discovers how each bag is filled with nitrogen to keep the crisps from going stale and how they are distributed. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers the secrets of perfect crisp potatoes, as well the surprising ways that our brain can be tricked into thinking a crisp is much crunchier than it really is. She also finds out how more than a third of savoury snacks consumed in the UK are made from corn and follows the production of Monster Munch. And historian Ruth Goodman investigates who really invented the crisp - was it the Americans, as is often cited, or the British?.</desc>

<desc>Dara begins his journey by revealing how the moon governs time. Returning to Ireland, near where he grew up, he goes to Newgrange ‚Äì an ancient archaeological site near the Wicklow Mountains. Its an enormous solar calendar but it is now suggested that the mysterious markings on stones around the site could make it the worlds first lunar calendars too, created by stone-age farmers to help them plan their crops. We discover how much the moon still influences life on earth. Farmer Julian Ellis plans his farming according to the phases of the moon. And we discover how much the moons immense influence on the tides also governs fisherman Sam Jones daily life. Dara next travels to the coasts of Kent to meet astrobiologist Professor Lewis Dartnell to find out just how far the moons influence on life on earth extends. Lewis explains how important the moons pull on the Earths tides has been to evolution for the animals that live in coastal areas but also on human evolution. But does the moon still affect life on earth and directly affect people, as many believe? Dara meets Dr. Rohin Francis to dig deeper into the myths surrounding the moons influence on human behavior, and to discuss some of the latest evidence. But regardless of the myths and legends ‚Äì the one way the moon undoubtably shaped our history was the race to put a human on the moon. Dara meets Dr Katie Joy who studies moon rocks brought back from the Apollo missions to find out what they discovered from them and are still discovering. Katie explains there is a new race to the moon because, incredibly, locked up in rocks across the lunar surface is believed to be vast amounts of water.</desc>

<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<sub-title>Panama</sub-title>
<desc>As always, Ben joins a variety of brave folks who chose to venture down a very alternative path to everyday life. The aim is to discover the reality of leaving it all behind, and meet those who have chosen to ditch a life dominated by debts and the daily grind to go in search of something different. This week, Ben ventures to Central America and a remote island off the coast of Panama. His host Jaimie is an inventor who has built a unique home and an unconventional family, to create his own wild utopia. Ben gets stuck into island life, from scrubbing boat hulls and hacking through vegetation, to pedalo exercising and home schooling. He questions the unusual family dynamics in this house, and joins his eccentric host to sample his inventions‚Äîfrom a fart machine to cook on, to a computer game based on his life.</desc>

<title>Alexander Armstrong Sri Lankal</title>
<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<sub-title>Aliens</sub-title>
<desc>Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system. Brian descends to the bottom of the Pacific in a submarine to witness the extraordinary life forms that survive in the cold, black waters. All life on Earth needs water so the search for aliens in the solar system has followed the search for water. Soaring above the dramatic Scablands of the United States, Brian discovers how the same landscape has been found on Mars. And it was all carved out in a geological heartbeat by a monumental flood. Armed with a gas mask, Brian enters a cave in Mexico where bacteria breathe toxic gas and leak concentrated acid. Yet relatives of these creatures could be surviving in newly discovered caves on Mars. But Brians sixth wonder isnt a planet at all. Jupiters moon Europa is a dazzling ball of ice etched with strange cracks. The patterns in the ice reveal that, far below, there is an ocean with more potentially life-giving water than all the oceans on Earth. Of all the wonders of the solar system forged by the laws of nature, there is one that stands out. In the final episode of this series, Brian reveals the greatest wonder of them all.</desc>

<desc>Documentary series. Gregg Wallace helps to unload 27 tonnes of dried haricot beans from North America and follows them on a one and a half mile journey through the largest baked bean factory in the world, which makes more than three million cans of beans every 24 hours. Gregg discovers how a laser scrutinizes every single bean, how the spice recipe for the sauce is a secret known only by two people and how the beans are not baked at all! Cherry Healey follows the journey of a discarded baked bean can through a recycling centre and on to the largest steelworks in the UK. She also takes a can that is 14 months after its best before date to a lab at the University of Coventry and is amazed when tests reveal it has the same Vitamin C levels compared to fresh tomatoes. Historian Ruth Goodman reveals how tinned food was invented to prevent British seamen developing scurvy on their long voyages at sea. Ruth also relates how Henry Heinz first marketed baked beans in the UK in the early 1900s.</desc>

<title>Planet Earth III</title>
<sub-title>Human</sub-title>
<desc>The human world, from our cities to our fields, has spread to every corner of the globe. Wildlife must now adapt to a vastly altered landscape... and contend directly with us. Some animals are meeting this challenge head-on and thriving. In Bali, long-tailed macaques have learned to steal tourists most precious items and then use them to barter with temple staff for their favourite food. The older males simply wont give you back your phone unless they get what theyre after. For many animals living alongside us, it pays to keep a low profile. Tawny frogmouths are masters of camouflage, and in Melbourne, Australia, they are preyed upon by pet cats. Nevertheless, frogmouths are doing well here because the streetlights help them find their prey, and in many parts of the city they are now found in a higher density than in the surrounding countryside. Some animals are so bold, they dont even try to hide. Rhinos walk through the streets of Sauraha, Nepal, simply to reach food on the other side of town. In Lake Tahoe, USA, black bears head right to the centre of town in search of food. Ahead of hibernation, it is crucial to put on as much weight as possible. The rich food these city bears can find in the dumpsters means that they are up to 50 per cent heavier than their country cousins. Some enterprising individuals have gone a step further. They have worked out that a simple push on a door can lead them into a room stacked high with food. Quite a surprise for someone popping into the shop to buy a snack. For wildlife, part of the challenge is to keep up with us. Pavement ants are the most common ant in New York City, outnumbering New Yorkers by 1,000 to 1. The secret to their success is their digestive system, which has been able to keep pace with the constantly changing human diet. Ninety per cent of what they eat now comes from human food. On Broadway Avenue alone, they eat the equivalent of 60,000 hotdogs a year. Life is not so straightforward for animals that are feared or persecuted by humans. Snakebites cause an estimated 60,000 human deaths every year in India alone, but in one Indian village, venomous cobras are seen hunting inside peoples houses. Remarkably, scientists believe that this co-existence has led to a change in the snakes behaviour. They move more slowly and are less likely to strike when disturbed. However, when animals come into the human world to compete for resources, it often leads to conflict. In Kenya, once the sun has set, African elephant bulls venture to fields of tomatoes to gorge. Its a dangerous job for the farmers trying to repel the largest land animals on the planet. Wildlife that eat the same food as humans doesnt always result in competition. Humpback whales off the coast of Vancouver Island inhabit waters that have been overfished. You would think that their presence would reduce fish stocks even further, but astonishingly the opposite is thought to be happening. It is all because of the iron in the whales poo! It fertilises the ocean here and feeds the phytoplankton, which is the basis of the food chain. The fish feed on the growing phytoplankton population and, even though the whales are feasting on them, their numbers are predicted to increase. Not only do the whales, and their poo, play an important role in restoring the ecosystem, but they also combat climate change. The phytoplankton photosynthesise, taking carbon out of the atmosphere, just like trees do. Thanks to whale poo, their numbers grow to such an extent that each great whale has the same impact as planting 30,000 trees! Although some species are managing to thrive in the human world, in many parts our actions are putting unprecedented pressure on wildlife. Our fates, however, are closely intertwined. If the natural world is not protected, it could be devastating for all of us. The major challenge will be reimagining the way we live on this planet to find ways to protect all life on earth.</desc>

<title>Glass - A Descent into the Maelstrom</title>
<desc>"A Descent into the Maelstrom" (1841) is American writer Edgar Allan Poes short story of two fishermen caught in torrents raging between the mountainous islands of Lofoten, inside the Arctic Circle of northern Norway. After a treacherous whirlpool drags their boat down, only one of them survives. American composer Philipp Glass based his choral work for the Australian Dance Theatre on this story. The piece was performed at the Adelaide Festival of Arts in 1986. Beacon Isle Films recorded an arrangement of Glasss work for symphony orchestra, performed by the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir conducted by Tim Weiss. Soprano Berit Norbakken Solset is the soloist. The Artic Philharmonic Orchestra is the worlds youngest and northernmost professional orchestral institution, presenting circa 150 performances and concerts each year. This 2019 recording was made against the backdrop of Lofotens spectacular landscape: the very surroundings that inspired Poes story.</desc>

<title>Heitor Villa-Lobos Music for Cello and Piano - IV</title>
<desc>In this six-part documentary on the life and work of Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, director Liloye Boubli takes viewers on a journey through the life and work of this legend of Brazilian classical music. The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887. Growing up during a time of immense social change in Brazil - with the abolishment of slavery in 1888, this was a time of social revolution and far-reaching modernizations - Villa-Lobos went on to become one of South Americas best-known composers of all time. This fourth episode dives deeper into the composers "Bachianas brasileiras", particularly the "√Åria (Cantilena)" from Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, which is one of Villa-Loboss most renowned pieces.</desc>

<title>Mozart - String Quartet No. 19 in C major, K. 465</title>
<desc>Les Dissonances is a collective of artists founded by violinist David Grimal in 2004. The conductorless ensemble consists of musicians from the most prestigious European orchestras, international soloists, and young talents. In this performance, Les Dissonances string quartet - consisting of David Grimal (violin), Hans Peter Hofmann (violin), David Gaillard (viola), and Xavier Phillips (cello) - performs Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts String Quartet No. 19 in C major, K. 465, "Dissonance" (Op. 10 No. 6). The String Quartet is the last in the set of six quartets that were dedicated to Joseph Haydn. Written between 1782 and 1785, these are also known as the Haydn Quartets (Op. 10). String Quartet No. 19 is remarkable for its slow, dissonant introduction, giving the piece its nickname. This ominous passage suddenly gives way to the bright Allegro in C major. This performance was recorded at Opera Comique in Paris, France, in 2015.</desc>

<desc>Celebrated German violinist Isabelle Faust performs two of J. S. Bachs incredible works for solo violin: Partita No. 2 in D minor (BWV 1004), and Sonata No. 3 in C major (BWV 1005). Both works are part of the composers well-known Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (BWV 1001-1006). Partita No. 2 is made up of four dance movements, concluded by its famous Chaconne, a monumental piece within the violin repertoire. In this Chaconne, Bach develops a series of continuous variations from a theme, exploring a complex range of harmonic possibilities. Sonata No. 3 includes an extensive fugue in which Bach employs many contrapuntal techniques. In this wonderful performance, Faust shows her mastery of Bachs technically challenging pieces.

<sub-title>Jansons conductcs Stravinsky: Hummel and Beethoven</sub-title>
<desc>"Everything about Mariss Jansons exudes joy and sovereignty" raved Suddeutsche Zeitung in January 2018, when the celebrated conductor celebrated his 75th birthday at Munichs Philharmonie am Gasteig with a concert program that centered around the music of Stravinsky, Hummel and Beethoven. This thrilling, varied concert from with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra demonstrates the close relationship which has developed between conductor and orchestra over the past 15 years. Stravinskys Symphony in Three Movements was written in 1942-45, inspired in part by the Second World War and the "abhorrent pictures" of the war he saw in newsreel footage. Albeit in a very different way, Johann Nepomuk Hummels Trumpet Concerto also sparkles. Written in 1803, the concerto is a brilliantly crafted showpiece for the recently invented keyed trumpet. Here the trumpeter is Martin Angerer, Principal Trumpet of the BRSO in warm rapport with Jansons and the orchestra. Beethoven, one of Jansonss dearest composers, rounds out the concert. Although Beethovens Mass in C, written in 1807, was his first Mass setting, it is a work of clear ambition.</desc>

<title>Haydn - Symphony No. 45 "Farewell"</title>
<desc>Under the direction of Conrad van Alphen, the Sinfonia Rotterdam Orchestra performs Haydns Symphony No. 45 at the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church) in The Hague. This piece is nicknamed "Farewell" because of a funny anecdote. Haydn and his musicians stayed every year from May to October at the magnificent Esterh√°azy Palace, at the request of Prince Nicholas. In early November 1772, the prince announced his intention to remain at the palace for two more months. The musicians then told Kapellmeister Haydn their disagreement with this forced extension of their stay. The solution proposed by Haydn was to compose a piece delivering a clear message: at the end of the last movement of the Symphony, the musicians were called to blow the candles on their lectern and leave the room one after the other. Prince Nicholas understood the message; the next day a car was waiting for the musicians to take them home.</desc>

<desc>Pierre Boulez conducts the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the Adagio from Mahlers Symphony No. 10 and the song cycle Des Knaben Wunderhorn. Soloists are Magdalena Ko≈æen√° (mezzo-soprano) and Christian Gerhaher (baritone). This concert was recorded at the orchestras home base, Severance Hall, in February 2010. Among Mahlers orchestral songs, those of Des Knaben Wunderhorn occupy a special position: written in the 1890s, they are of ground-breaking importance in his oeuvre, since they helped establish a genre that had few precedents before him. Moreover, they also served as sources of inspiration, both musical and poetic, for the symphonies he wrote during this time. Mahler famously said a symphony should take in the entire world. Hed be pleased, then, by this performance of the "Adagio" from the unfinished Symphony No. 10, which somehow packed the world into a single movement.</desc>

<title>Schumann - Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13</title>
<desc>After recording all 32 Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas to celebrate the composers 250th birth anniversary, celebrated Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz decided to record solo piano works by Robert Schumann. In this performance, Schwartz presents Schumanns Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13. Composed between 1834-37, the work began as a theme and a set of sixteen variations. The theme had been composed by Baron von Fricken, an amateur musician and father of Ernestine von Fricken, to whom Schumann was engaged in 1834. The work was first published in 1837, containing the theme and twelve etudes (only nine of them were indicated variations). Fifteen years later, in 1852, Schumann published a second edition of the work, eliminating two etudes and making some revisions to the piano writing. Acclaimed pianist Riccardo Schwartz (1986) has performed as a soloist with many world-renowned conductors, including Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov. His acclaimed performances include recitals and concertos for piano and orchestra in many prestigious concert halls.</desc>

<title>Europakonzert 2013 - Prague</title>
<desc>Every year since 1991, the Berliner Philharmoniker has given concerts in a different European city on each May 1st. These concerts have become known as Europakonzert. Every guest city has its own special cultural importance. These concerts have served two purposes: to commemorate the anniversary of the orchestras founding on May 1st, 1882, and to celebrate the common heritage of the Old World. In 1991, soon after the opening of the Eastern European countries, the first Europakonzert took place in the Czech Republic in Prague. This decision was a deliberate step and an expression of willingness to support and to bring forward the democratization and the political social changes, especially in the cultural area. In 1996 the Europakonzert took place once again in Prague (at the National Theatre). To continue this tradition the Europakonzert 2013 was celebrated at the Prague Castle at the historical Spanish Hall. Conductor: Sir Simon Rattle. Soloist: Magdalena Kozen√°. Works: Ralph Vaughan Williams, Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Ten Biblical Songs, Opus 99. Ludwig van Beethoven, Symphony No. 6 in F Major, Op. 68.</desc>

<title>Sibelius - Symphony No. 4</title>
<desc>In 2013, the Finnish conductor Hannu Lintu was appointed principal conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Lintu studied piano and cello at the Sibelius Academy and the Turku conservatorium in Swedens southeast. He started conducting at the Sibelius Academy. His many concerts with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2012 made him the obvious replacement for Sakari Oramo, who, after many years as conductor and concert master, terminated his contract in 2012. The orchestra specializes in the performance of Finnish music, but also performs the great masterpieces of Gustav Mahler and Bela Bartok. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius is the orchestras favourite, as well as the conductor. In cooperation with Finlands national public broadcasting company Yle, all seven Sibelius symphonies are recorded and broadcast. After a brief spoken introduction about the piece, the orchestra performs the complete symphony. After Sibelius was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1908, he changed his lifestyle as well as his approach to composition. Fearing death, he quit using alcohol and tobacco. Simultaneously, the harmonies in his works grew darker and more sombre. Devils and death are among the images conjured up by the gloomy sounds of this Symphony.</desc>

In C(H)≈íURS, his biggest project yet, he examines how dangerously beautiful a group can be. What is the relationship between the progressive 19th-century nationalism of Verdi and Wagner and the current tendency for countries to close themselves off? Platel looks at the emotions that arise from the assembly of individuals within groups, reflects on the dynamics of collective movements, and explores the boundary between the public and the individual. C(H)≈íURS features magnificent choral scenes with over 80 singers, dancers and musicians and was premiered on March 12, 2012 at the Teatro Real Madrid.</desc>

<title>Brahms - Violin Concerto</title>
<desc>Israeli violinist Itzhak Perlman and the Berlin Philharmonic perform Johannes Brahms Violin Concerto (1833-1897) under the direction of Daniel Barenboim. After Beethovens Violin Concerto, Brahms piece is probably the most famous German Violin Concerto ever written. These two works have much in common, especially the tone in D major in which they were composed. Highly technical, Brahms Violin Concerto is reserved for virtuosos because of the marked presence of arpeggios, rapid passages of scales and rhythmic variations. Perlman and the Berlin Philharmonic are brilliantly meeting the challenge of this technically and intellectually demanding work.</desc>

These technical developments allowed this essentially ephemeral art form to be preserved.

<title>The 77 Percent</title>
<desc>77 per cent of Africas population are below the age of thirty-five yet their interests are under-represented poltically and economically. This show aims to redress the balance by providing a voice to the largest demographic group on the continent. These dynamic younger people are politically engaged and will determine the future path their countries, and the continent as a whole, will follow in the twenty-first century. Presented by Eddy Micah Jr. from Ghana and Wanjiku Mwaura from Kenya, the show promotes a pan-African agenda by encouraging dialogue between the various interested parties. The show pulls no punches when delivering its compelling reports, personal accounts and provocative discussions. A long overdue look at the big issues that affect the youth of Africa.</desc>

<desc>Eco Africa highlights the innovative and inspiring projects from across Africa and Europe that are being put into practice in a a bid to tackle climate change and support our depleting environments. In Africa especially, huge numbers of animal and wildlife species have dramatically fallen, largely due to a vast increase in human population across the continent. The increasing population is taking over vast swathes of natural land and in turn, adding to the demand for natural resources. This series explores the different concepts being used to help sustain our future, such as alternative resources, biodiversity conservation and the future of travel.</desc>

<title>Salif Keita and Les Ambassadeurs</title>
<desc>Salif Keitas music is a rich combination of traditional Malian music with European and American influences. We can hear this in the instrumentation of Keitas music, which varies from traditional West-African instruments to Western European ones. The Malian singer was cast out by his family because of his albinism. In 1967 he moved to Bamako, where he started his musical career and joined Les Ambassadeurs (Internationaux). He achieved international acknowledgement with this band in the 1970s. After spending a couple of years in Ivory Coast, Salif has found his home base in Paris since 1984. During this 2010 concert, he proves to be rightfully referred to as "The Golden Voice of Africa".</desc>

<title>Coleman Hawkins live in Belgium, 1962</title>
<desc>A jazz festival named after the inventor of the instrument most associated with the genre, Adolphe Sax, would be incomplete without the man who laid the groundwork for how the instrument is played today. This must have been the reasoning of the organizers of the Festival International de Jazz Adolphe Sax in Dinant, Belgium, when they invited tenor saxophone giant Coleman Hawkins to perform there in June 1962. Appearing with a group that includes the French pianist George Arvanitas, one-time Duke Ellington bassist Jimmy Woode, and expat drummer Kansas Fields, the musician also known as "Bean" and "Hawk" serves up an hour-long set of familiar standards bookended by Hank Jones "Chant" and J. J. Johnsons "Wee Dot".</desc>

<title>Seine Sessions</title>
<sub-title>Legendary Jazz</sub-title>
<desc>The term "jam-session" was coined in the 1920s when black and white musicians gathered in smoke-filled bars after their respective concerts to enjoy the kind of jazz they could not play in traditional sets. Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call "jammin the beat". Today, the Seine Sessions revive the happy years of "jam sessions", while the cream of jazz, blues, gipsy and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le Reservoir. Titled "Legendary Jazz", this episode hosted by Eddy King features unique performances by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with Steve McCraven, Oona Guino, Rodolphe Lauretta, and many others.</desc>

<title>Where Are We Now - Part I</title>
<desc>German jazz and cabaret singer Atrin Madani was born in 1998 as the son of Iranian immigrants. In the face of pandemic uncertainty, geopolitical upheaval, and social unrest in his ancestral home country, Madani asked himself: where are we now? His response to this question is as clear and precise as his singing: what we need most right now is honesty, humility, and quality. All of these are abundantly present on the Berlin-based vocalists debut album. Inspired by the sound aesthetics of Mel Torme, Norah Jones, Diana Krall, and Till Bronner, Madani dedicates himself to a handpicked selection of songs that have so far remained largely unsung in jazz.

At this concert at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, Peter Beets teams up with the world-famous guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. With a career spanning almost twenty-five years and including collaborating with dynamic peers like Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, as well as esteemed jazz legends like Joe Henderson, Paul Motian and Gary Burton, Rosenwinkels indelible mark in music is the consummation of being steeped in the rich and deep traditions of jazz, springing off of the shoulders of such vital underpinnings to elevate his own art to new heights, evolving the language in a way no other guitarist has since his arrival.

<sub-title>Comblain-la-Tour Jazz Festival: Jimmy McGriff Trio</sub-title>
<desc>As one of the best Hammond B3 organ players, Jimmy McGriff (1936-2008) is often lost among great soul-jazz organists from his hometown of Philadelphia. Of the major soul-jazz pioneers, he was the bluesiest and often insisted that he was more of a blues musician than a jazz artist. Regardless, he remained eclectic enough to blur the lines of genres. His sound - deep, down-to-earth grooves drenched in blues and gospel feeling - made him popular with RandB audiences. This 1965 performance is part of the Comblain-la-Tour Jazz Festival.</desc>

<desc>The term "jam-session" was born in the 1920s, when black and white musicians gathered in smoke-filled bars after their respective concerts to enjoy the kind of jazz they could not play in traditional sets. Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call "jammin the beat". Today, the Seine Sessions revive the happy years of "jam sessions", while the cream of jazz, blues, gipsy and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le Reservoir. Entitled "Free and Afro Jazz," this episode hosted by Eddy King features unique performances by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with Fantazio, Eddy Lopez, Banoit Savard, and many others.</desc>

<sub-title>Schloss Ansbach: Ornette Coleman Sextet</sub-title>
<desc>Harmolodics, the musical philosophy of jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman, is associated primarily with avant-garde jazz and the free jazz movement, although its implications extend beyond these limits. Coleman defined "harmolodics" as "the use of the physical and the mental of ones own logic made into an expression of sound to bring about the musical sensation of unison executed by a single person or with a group". Applied to the particulars of music, this means that harmony, melody, speed, rhythm, time and phrases all have equal position in the results that come from the placing and spacing of ideas - as evidenced in this broadcast of a performance by the Ornette Coleman Sextet.</desc>

<sub-title>Tim Kliphuis and the NCO: The Changing Seasons</sub-title>
<desc>The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra commissioned violinist Tim Kliphuis, internationally known for his genre-crossing approach to music, to write a new version of Antonio Vivaldis Four Seasons. Kliphuis choose to take improvisation as his starting point; at the same time, he intended to leave the best-known Vivaldi themes and chords in, as they give the piece its wonderful energy. The result is a fresh and exciting interpretation that never loses sight of the original. Each season has a different character: the freshness of spring is reflected by the use of Irish and Norwegian traditional music; the summer heat can be heard in the American jazz and funk rhythms; the autumn includes a galloping safari hunt in South-Africa and the ice-cold winter warms up with the energy of Russian gypsy music. For each movement, Kliphuis has a metropole in mind which he visited on his previous concert tours. Youre about to witness a truly genre-crossing spectacle!</desc>

<title>Tudruk mootorrattal</title>
<desc>R: Jack Cardiff. O: Marianne Faithfull, Alain Delon. Tudinenud abielust ja turvalisest koduperenaise elust, asub noor ning kaunis Rebecca oma uleni musta Harley Davidsoniga kihutama labi Euroopa, et leida ules oma armuke Daniel. Ennasthavitav teekond kujutab endast t√µeliselt psuhhedeelset trippi, oodi ulimale vabadustundele, kus olevik seguneb erootiliste malupiltidega, mil Rebecca kiindus nii Danielisse kui ka mootorratastesse. Jack Cardiffi ("Must nartsiss", parima operaatoritoo Oscar, 1948) toonast ajastuh√µngu hasti tabav film sai menukaks tanu naispeaosataitja Marianne Faithfullile ("Hamlet", "Marie Antoinette"), kelle liiga seksikaks osutunud liibuv must nahkkostuum ja alastistseenid viisid tsensorid nii kaugele, et sellele anti Ameerika kinodes esmakordselt X-reiting (lastele sobimatu sisu ja keelekasutus). Filmi k√µrvalosa kehastab Prantsuse sudametemurdja Alain Delon ("Gepard", "Samurai").</desc>

<desc>R: Brian Helgeland. O: Tom Hardy, Emily Browning. Auhindadega parjatud krimip√µnevik Londoni legendaarsetest gangsteritest, keda kehastab Oscari nominent Tom Hardy ("Mees, kes jai ellu", "Mad Max: raevu tee"). T√µsielulistel sundmustel p√µhinev linateos viib vaataja svingivasse Londonisse 1960. aastatel, kus allmaailma valitsevad kardetud identsed kaksikud Reggie ja Ron Kray. Paraku hakkab nende tulutoov pereari peagi allamage veerema, sest uhte vendadest vaevavad pidevad vagivallahood, mida teine ei suuda enam kontrolli all hoida. Filmi on lavastanud parima stsenaariumi Oscari palvinud Brian Helgeland ("Los Angelese rapased saladused"). Tom Hardy parjati parimaks meesnaitlejaks Briti s√µltumatu filmi auhinnagalal.</desc>

<title>Ka gangster on inimene</title>
<desc>Komoodia gangsteribossist Paul Vittist (Robert De Niro), keda tabavad uhtakki kohutavad hadad: teda vaevavad paanikahood, ta ei suuda enam oma armukesega murada ja tagatipuks puhkeb taisj√µus mees alatihti ilma p√µhjuseta nutma. Viimaks poordub ta psuhhiaater Beni (Billy Crystal) poole ja hirmunud hingetohter n√µustubki gangsteri terveks ravima. Aega selleks on aga vaga vahe, sest tulekul on otsustava tahtsusega maffia tippkohtumine. Film ei sobi alaealistele.</desc>

Sweets viimistleb veel nende partnerlusest kirjutatud raamatut, Brennan ja Booth kasutavad aga v√µimalust, et asjad sirgeks raakida. Noor ja maslev FBI agent Booth poordub abi saamiseks antropoloogia teadlaste ruhma ja tanavakunstniku poole. Ta otsib asit√µendeid, millega t√µestada k√µrgetasemelise kahtlusaluse suud. Vaatamata tundmatule territooriumile asub dr. Brennan koos k√µrgharitud uli√µpilase Zacki ja Hodginsiga kohe toole, avaldades Boothile oma osavate v√µtetega muljet. Nimelt √µnnestus neil avastada uued juhtl√µngad ja t√µendada Boothi teooriat heade sidemetega ringkonnakohtuniku kohta. Samal ajal kui antud juhtum loob soodsa pinnase tulevaseks viljakaks koostooks, annab see ka aimdust lahtirulluvatest romantilistest sugemetest. Need tunded oleksid selle muljetavaldava meeskonna peaaegu havitanud, ent need ei ole siiani kuhugi kadunud.</desc>

Tunnetekeerises oma valjavalitut paremini tundma √µppides saab Popi teada, et Haru minevik peidab suurt saladust. Nimelt kuulus ta minevikus... pooraselt populaarsesse poistebandi BroZone! See pole veel k√µik, pealekauba olid ulejaanud bandiliikmed Haru vennad, kellest ta seni s√µnakestki poetanud pole! BroZone lagunes siis, kui Haru oli alles trollitita, habras oksake, ning sellest ajast pole ta teisi enam nainud. Kui aga uks vendadest, Floyd, kahe kuulsusejanus, aga t√µsise talendipuudega superstaarihakatise poolt roovitakse, asuvad Haru ja Popi ohtlikule ja emotsionaalsele teekonnale, et vennad taas kokku tuua. Sest vaid nii saaks nad paasta uhe omade seast saatusest, mis veel hullem kui kuulsuse kadumine!</desc>

We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons. Some are following their dreams of a simpler lifestyle.</desc>

We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons. Some are following their dreams of a simpler lifestyle.</desc>

<sub-title>Off-Grid Tiny</sub-title>
<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons. Some are following their dreams of a simpler lifestyle.</desc>

The crowd went wild, but to Casablancas, it was clearly a joke. He was playing a role and said as much outright at the beginning of the show, but that didnt stop the crowd, hungry for more entertainment, from taking him seriously.</desc>

<sub-title>The Grateful Dead - Classic Albums: Anthem To Beauty</sub-title>
<desc>This installment of the Classic Albums series follows the making of two Grateful Dead albums, the fiercely experimental Anthem of the Sun and the understated masterwork American Beauty, which spawned melodic gems like "Sugar Magnolia" and "Ripple." Between the archival scenes and contemporary interviews with band members, the program shows a band making seismic in roads in pop music and five young guys coming to terms with artistry, mortality, and, yes, the pursuit of happiness. There is priceless footage of Neal Cassady driving Ken Keseys bus and of the Dead, surrounded by martini sipping hipsters, on Playboy After Dark. The best scenes involve band members talking about specific songs (you will never hear Phil Leshs "Box of Rain" again without thinking of it as a gift to his dying father) or deconstructing a tune by playing each track separately. Intimate and surprisingly cohesive, Anthem to Beauty is a rare glimpse into how the Deads magic was made.</desc>

Along with collaborator and musical guru Ludwig Gransson on electric guitar, Gambino rips through tracks from his wildly popular EP as well as the lead single from his debut album Camp (out now on Glassnote Records).

<title>Truth About Murder With Sunny Hostin</title>
<sub-title>T√°mad√°s a parkban</sub-title>
<desc>Host, and former federal prosecutor, Sunny Hostin (from The View) takes us on an investigative journey to uncover the true stories of crime victims and their loved ones. Unlike most crime shows which focus on the motives or backstory of the killers, this show exposes the real, deadly impact on those who suffer at the hands of the perpetrator. The stories of everyday people who get caught up in these heinous crimes often go unheard and it is equally important that these individuals get to tell their stories as it is for us to hear them. Sunny also interviews the detectives, prosecutors, coroners, and others involved to piece together the truth of each case. With an intention to be socially inclusive, the show highlights stories concerning people of color, women and the LGBTQ community.</desc>

<desc>Vaba naine vabal maal v√µib olla just tapselt nii kole, kui ta ise tahab. Seda teab vallavanema naine paris tapselt ja edasine on juba vallavanema probleem. Krista eneseteadvuse t√µus suunab ta niimoodi jalle vallavalitsusse ruppe toole. Kirik√µpetajal on mure surijatega. Viimasel ajal kipuvad vallakodanikud lusikat nurka viskama valla k√µige kaugemates nurkades.

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Bizarre New World</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Say OK</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

Hier und da ist allerdings auch mal ein wenig Raum fur ernsthaftere Tone, denn es passieren auch schlimme Dinge in der Welt.</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia.

Zwar ist vor allem im Badezimmer noch einiges zu tun, doch das Erdgeschoss ist endlich fertig. Mit funf Monaten Verzogerung kann Karin nun einziehen.

<desc>Nach drei Jahren Pause ist das Erfolgsformat nun wieder zuruck. Ab dem 12. Marz laufen die neuen Folgen jeden Mittwoch um 20:15 Uhr bei RTLZWEI und schon sieben Tage vorher auf RTL+. Aber welches Team kennt sich am besten, wer harmoniert wirklich und zwischen wem fliegen direkt die Fetzen? Sieben Freundschafts- und Liebes-Duos wollen sich dieses Jahr wieder das Preisgeld von bis zu 100.000 Euro erkampfen. Wie hoch der Gewinn am Ende wirklich ausfallt, entscheidet sich wie immer durch die Spiele. Auch wenn die naturlich viel Action und Spannung versprechen, bleibt die groSSte Herausforderung aber vermutlich das Zusammenleben untereinander und mit dem ein oder anderen verfeindetem Gegner-Paar.</desc>

Trotz enormer Gewalteinwirkung auf den Schadel konnen die Forensiker die Identitat des Mannes ermitteln - Roy Radin, ein Broadway Produzent aus New York. Schnell finden die Ermittler heraus, dass Radin mit seiner Geschaftspartnerin Lanie Jacobs in Streit geraten war. Doch Jacobs ist bereits aus Los Angeles verschwunden. Einige Monate spater verhaftet die Polizei einen der Bodyguards Jacobs und kann den Mann in Zusammenhang mit dem Mord bringen. Doch konnen die Beamten beweisen, dass Lanie Jacobs die Tat geplant und beauftragt hat? Morderische Gier - Lakeland, Florida. In einem Wagen wird die Leiche eines Mannes gefunden.

<desc>Todliche Gewasser - Drei grausame Morde an Frauen erschuttern Palm Beach. Ein Serienmorder treibt sein Unwesen und konnte bisher nicht gestoppt werden. Da wird eine vierte Leiche entdeckt und die Befurchtung steht im Raum, dass der Killer erneut zugeschlagen hat. Die ermittelnden Beamten bitten Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Die erfahrene Profilerin soll klaren, ob Rene Baker ebenfalls dem Serientater zum Opfer fiel. Dale ist sich rasch sicher, dass es sich um einen anderen Tater handeln muss. Die einzige Spur, die dieser am Tatort hinterlassen hat ist ein Zigarettenstummel. Kann der Morder damit uberfuhrt werden? Blutige FuSSspuren - Sabatino Russo und seine Frau Eugenia betreiben ein kleines italienisches Restaurant in Hollywood. Insbesondere die lokalen Polizisten gehoren zu ihren Stammkunden. Umso schockierter sind die Beamten, als sie zur Szenerie eines grausamen Doppelmordes gerufen werden und die beiden Wirtsleute als Opfer vorfinden. Der Tatort gibt Ratsel auf - die Leichen liegen in verschiedenen Zimmern, ein Besenstiel und ein Wischmopp liegen auffallig herum. Beide Opfer wurden geschlagen, aber die Todesursache sind heftige Schnitt- und Stichwunden. Bei der Obduktion finden die Gerichtsmediziner einen Teil eines Messers im Kopf eines der Opfer. Doch sonst gibt es kaum Spuren. Alleine die drei neuen Bodensafes, die das Paar hatte einbauen lassen, geben einen Hinweis. Wer wusste von diesen Safes?

<title>Extra - Das RTL Magazin</title>
<desc>Erstmals seit 2022 ist EXTRA-Reporterin Liv von Boetticher im Februar unter schwierigsten Bedingungen nach Afghanistan gereist, um sich auf die Suche nach den 28 afghanischen Straftatern zu machen, die im Sommer 2024 in ihr Herkunftsland abgeschoben wurden. Was passierte mit den Mannern nach Ankunft in Kabul? Und welches Leben fuhren sie heute? Liv von Boetticher ist es gelungen, mit vier von ihnen zu sprechen. Die ganze Recherche zeigt RTL am 11. Marz um 22:30 Uhr in EXTRA. Das EXTRA-Team fand heraus, dass die abgeschobenen Manner im ganzen Land verteilt sind und reiste unter anderem fur ein Gesprach mit Mukhtiar N., einem der Vergewaltiger von Illerkirchberg, bis an die Grenze zu Pakistan. Sein Fall sorgte in den letzten Jahren immer wieder fur Diskussionen: 2019 vergewaltigte er gemeinsam mit drei anderen Asylbewerbern ein 14-jahriges Madchen, saSS daraufhin fur rund zwei Jahre in Haft und wurde schlieSSlich im August 2024 nach Afghanistan abgeschoben. "Einige der Manner, mit denen wir gesprochen haben, darunter auch der Vergewaltiger aus Illerkirchberg, wollen zuruck nach Deutschland und haben auch fest vor, dies in die Tat umzusetzen", sagt Liv von Boetticher. Im Fall von Mukhtiar N. komme hinzu, dass er in Deutschland Frau und Kind hat, wie er gegenuber EXTRA bestatigte. Andere haben sich in Afghanistan wiederum ein neues Leben aufgebaut. Abdul Fazeli, ein Mehrfach- und Intensivstraftater, lebt inzwischen in Kabul und besitzt mehrere Laden. Im Gesprach mit Reporterin Liv von Boetticher betont er, dass er nicht mehr nach Deutschland zuruckwolle: "Mir geht es gut. Fur mich war es eher so was wie ein Glucksfall, dass ich zuruck in mein Land bin." Sein in Deutschland erworbenes Fachwissen konne er in Afghanistan nutzen, um das Land und die Wirtschaft wieder mit aufzubauen. Die Taliban hatten ihn gut behandelt und er habe keine Probleme mit ihnen. Im Fokus der Recherchen steht auSSerdem Deutschlands Rolle im Ruckfuhrungsprozess. In mehreren Gesprachen wurde EXTRA-Reporterin Liv von Boetticher berichtet, dass die Manner tagelang am Flughafen festgehalten worden seien, bis ihre Identitaten einwandfrei geklart und Informationen uber die Straftaten in Deutschland eingeholt werden konnten. "Die Taliban wussten nichts von unseren Straftaten, denn Deutschland gibt daruber keine Auskunft. Die Wachen haben daher versucht herauszufinden, was jedem Einzelnen von uns vorgeworfen wird", schildert Abdul Fazeli die Situation vor Ort. Das Bundesministerium des Innern und fur Heimat (BMI) teilte auf Nachfrage der EXTRA-Redaktion mit: "Die Bundesregierung wurde bei der Vorbereitung und Durchfuhrung der Sammelabschiebung vom 30. August 2024 von einem regionalen Schlusselpartner unterstutzt. Sie hat keine direkten Gesprache mit der afghanischen de-facto-Regierung gefuhrt. Inhalte der Abstimmung werden vertraulich behandelt." Unter welchen Bedingungen kunftige Abschiebungen ablaufen konnten, dazu sprach Liv von Boetticher auch mit Taliban-Sprecher Zabiullah Mujahid: "Bei den Straftatern brauchten wir Zugriff oder zumindest Kenntnisse von Dossiers und Akten, damit wir das ordentlich rechtlich bearbeiten konnen und entsprechende MaSSnahmen treffen konnen."</desc>

<desc>Umwelt und Naturschutz sind eine wichtige Aufgabe von Bund und Landern. SchlieSSlich geht es dabei um den Schutz von Natur und Mensch. Eine tolle Sache sollte man meinen. Warum landen jedoch solche Umwelt- und Naturprojekte immer wieder in unserer Sendung? Weil sie leider allzu oft nach dem Prinzip "gut gemeint, schlecht gemacht" umgesetzt werden. Und so versickern die Steuergelder in nicht funktionierenden Fischtreppen oder werden fur sinnlose Aussichtsplattformen, verballert. Doch damit wird weder der Natur noch dem Menschen geholfen. Schade eigentlich. Um die Politik auf die Missstande aufmerksam zu machen, haben wir fur unsere neue Best-Of-Sendung die tierisch verrucktesten Falle von Steuergeldverschwendung bei Umwelt- und Naturprojekten ausgewahlt, bei denen selbst Grumpy-Cat sich vor Lachen schuttelt.</desc>

Das stern TV Spezial "Leben im Brennpunkt - Das Experiment" beantwortet all diese Fragen: hautnah und spannend.

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

Face √† lillettrisme dans les prisons, des benevoles devoues initient les detenus √† la lecture, pour leur reinsertion. Ce documentaire autour de la lecture en prison est lexploration dune relation entre des benevoles et des personnes incarcerees. Chaque semaine, ces benevoles se rendent aupr√®s des detenus pour les accompagner de fa√ßon individuelle dans une evasion mentale : la lecture. Gr√¢ce au livre et √† la litterature, le lien se cree, la parole se lib√®re, un horizon souvre √† la fois en termes de connaissances, de niveau, mais aussi de representation du monde. A travers les visites des benevoles, nous entrons dans un univers marque par les cliches et les fantasmes, o√π la litterature sert de fil conducteur, de mediation, doutil autoreflexif et bien souvent, de therapie. En off, les textes des fiches de lecture des personnes detenues racontent leurs doutes, leurs desillusions, leurs espoirs.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue.

Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne.

<desc>2019. aasta jaanuaris startis seitse Eesti automatjakat uliekstreemsele p√µhja-ekspeditsioonile ambitsioonika eesmargiga j√µuda esimeste inimestena tavamaasturitel Euraasia mandri k√µige p√µhjapoolsemasse punkti ‚Äì T≈°eljuskini neemele. Tee sinna on katkendlik ja inimtuhi ning randuritele on seltsiks vaid p√µhjap√µdrad, lumekanad, gigantsed janesed ja jaakarud. Kahekuulisele ekspeditsioonile starditi kolme eriettevalmistusega maasturiga. Paraku polnud ettevalmistustest ega ka kaasa veetud varustusest suuremat abi kaugel p√µhjas ees oodanud √µnnetuse vastu, sest uks maastur vajus vahetult enne sihtpunkti labi merejaa ja uppus.</desc>

<title>Armasta, ara unusta</title>
<desc>37-aastane Marina elab nagu tavaline tanapaeva lahutatud naine: kasvatab uksi 12-aastast tutart ja tootab kunstikoolis √µpetajana. Marinale naib, et tema elu on juba elatud ja midagi uut enam tulemas pole. Kuid k√µik muutub, kui naine tutvub juhuslikult Nikitaga. Noormees armub temasse esimesest pilgust ja teeb k√µik, et olla oma armastatu k√µrval. Kuid paraku on ta k√µigest 20-aastane. Vanusevahe Nikitat ei hairi, ta on valmis Marinaga abielluma. Kuid Marina kardab ja on kindel, et tema tutvuskond ei liida seda heaks. Naine on kahevahel ja p√µgeneb l√µpuks oma meeletu armastuse eest lapsep√µlvelinna. Marina vanemad viivad ta kokku oma uue naabri Igoriga. Igor on kindlameelne, vastutustundlik, Marinasse armunud ja mis p√µhiline, temaga uhevanune. Marina on n√µus saama Igori naiseks. Kuid kas Nikita loobub oma armastatud naisest?</desc>

<title>Palmid lumes</title>
<desc>Paralleelselt lahtihargnev lugu Hispaania perekonna kahest p√µlvkonnast, kelle saatus on seotud lummava Fernando Poo saarega Ekvatoriaal-Guineas. 1954. aastal saarele lainud peategelane Killian armub kakaoistandustoolise imekaunisse naisesse. Aastakumneid hiljem avastab Kiliani vennatutar Clarence, et onu on aastaid saatnud raha kellelegi Fernando Poo saarele, ja laheb hasti hoitud perekonnasaladust lahti harutama. Suurejooneliste kostuumide ja hingematvalt kaunite loodusvaadetega draama re≈æissoor on Fernando Gonz√°lez Molina. O: Mario Casas, Adriana Ugarte, Macarena Garc√≠a jt.</desc>

<title>Geheimsache Malta</title>
<desc>Ein ehemaliger CIA-Agent, der inzwischen als Auftragskiller fur eine Sondersektion arbeitet, muss lernen: Er totet nicht fur sein Land, sondern im Auftrag obskurer Hintermanner. Bei einem Job in Malta nahert sich ihm die MI6-Analystin Kacey, die ihn mit der bitteren Wahrheit konfrontiert. Gemeinsam machen sie sich auf die Suche nach den eigentlichen Drahtziehern der Morde und mussen feststellen, dass Totgeglaubte langer leben. Evan Shaw (Aaron Eckhart) ist ein international operierender Hitman, der seine Auftragsmorde fur eine Sondersektion der CIA begeht. Kopf der Sektion ist sein alter Freund Kevin Angler (Tim Roth). Von seinen Auftragen erfahrt Shaw, der in kompletter Anonymitat und Einsamkeit lebt, uber die Kleinanzeigen verschiedener Zeitungen. Sein aktueller Auftrag fuhrt ihn nach Rom, wo er in dem fur ihn gebuchten Luxushotel einen Koffer mit Waffen, Geld und Details zur nachsten Zielperson vorfindet. GroSS ist seine √úberraschung, als er eines Nachts Besuch von einer jungen Frau erhalt, die mehr uber sein Geschaft zu wissen scheint, als er selbst. Kacey Walker (Abigail Breslin) ist Analystin beim britischen Auslandsgeheimdienst MI6 und ist dem allein operierenden Hitman auf die Spur gekommen. Noch mehr: Sie kann Shaw glaubhaft nachweisen, dass dessen Freund und Boss Kevin Angler seit geraumer Zeit tot ist. Wer steckt dann hinter den Auftragen, die Shaw nach wie vor erhalt? Gemeinsam bricht das sehr unterschiedliche Duo nach Malta auf, wo nicht nur einige bittere Wahrheiten auf den wortkargen Ex-Agenten warten. Auch Kacey muss ihr eigenes Geheimnis luften. In dem amerikanisch-deutschen Actionfilm "Geheimsache Malta" darf Hollywood-Haudegen Aaron Eckhart ("London Has Fallen", "The Dark Knight") einmal mehr seine Schlagkraftigkeit unter Beweis stellen. An seiner Seite bringt Charakterdarstellerin Abigail Breslin ("Little Miss Sunshine", "Stillwater - Gegen jeden Verdacht") als ungewohnliche Geheimdienst-Mitarbeiterin die notige Prise Humor in diesen Kinofilm, der vor der schauprachtigen Kulisse der maltesischen Inselhauptstadt Valletta gedreht wurde. Das Darstellertrio wird komplettiert durch den britischen Schauspieler und Regisseur Tim Roth, der in der Rolle des vermeintlichen Agenten-Freundes Kevin Angler seine dunkle Seite zeigt.

<desc>Iris fahrt nach Stockholm zu ihrem fruheren Kollegen Adam. Bei einer Gegenuberstellung identifiziert sie einen Mann, der etwas mit dem Tod ihres Lebensgefahrten Christian zu tun hat. Obwohl es nicht erlaubt ist, lasst Adam Iris das Verhor des Verdachtigen mitverfolgen. Doch die Polizistin ist der Situation nicht gewachsen. Unterdessen wird in Ystad eine Anklage gegen den gestandigen Rovan wegen des Toten im Wald vorbereitet. Iris (Sofia Helin) muss bei den Ermittlungen um die im Wald gefundene Leiche zunachst eine Pause einlegen. Ihr fruherer Kollege Adam (Pablo Leiva Wenger) hat sie nach Stockholm eingeladen. Bei einer Gegenuberstellung soll Iris einen der mutmaSSlichen Morder ihres Lebensgefahrten Christian (Peter Gardiner) identifizieren.

Obwohl es nicht zulassig ist, erlaubt Adam Iris, das anschlieSSende Verhor vom √úberwachungsraum aus mitzuverfolgen. Doch sie hat ihre Emotionen nicht im Griff. Als die Befragung unterbrochen wird und Tim vermeintlich in ihre Richtung blickt, rastet Iris aus und greift ihn tatlich an. Adam ist verargert und besteht darauf, dass Iris so schnell wie moglich zuruck nach Ystad fahrt. Sie halt sich allerdings nicht daran und begibt sich in Stockholm eigenmachtig auf die Suche nach Anja (Naomi Bethke), die ebenfalls fur Christians Tod verantwortlich sein soll. Diese Aktion bringt Iris noch groSSeren √Ñrger ein. Unterdessen liegt in Malmo ein Bericht der Gerichtsmedizin vor. DNA-Spuren an der im Wald gefundenen Leiche lassen sich demnach dem gestandigen Rovan (Marco Cenaki) zuordnen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft bereitet die Anklage gegen ihn vor. Iris Kollege Jens (H√•kan Bengtsson) ist jedoch skeptisch. Er hat den Eindruck, dass Rovan seinen fruheren Arbeitgeber Sylvester (Hans-Christian Thulin) deckt. Free-TV-Premiere</desc>

<sub-title>Flucht</sub-title>
<desc>Iris ordnet an, dass die Akten zum Fall Benjamin wieder aus dem Archiv geholt werden. Sie stoSSt darin auf ein Detail, das die Lehrerin Hillevi in den Fokus der Ermittlungen ruckt. Diese war 2004 als junge Lehrkraft neu an der Schule und hat Benjamin unterrichtet. Als die Polizisten sie zu dem vermissten Teenager befragen, behauptet sie, ein rein professionelles Verhaltnis zu ihm gehabt zu haben. Iris hat Zweifel, ob das stimmt. Iris (Sofia Helin) kehrt aus Stockholm nach Ystad zuruck. Von ihren Mitarbeitern erfahrt sie, dass der Fall des fast 20 Jahre zuvor verschwundenen Teenagers Benjamin wieder zu den Akten gelegt wurde. Kerstin (Kajsa Ernst) hat offenbar dafur gesorgt. Sie hat seinerzeit selbst in dieser Sache ermittelt und ist kritisch gegenuber Iris eingestellt. Die neue Abteilungsleiterin nimmt das nicht einfach so hin: Iris ordnet an, dass die Akten wieder aus dem Archiv geholt werden. Sie selbst entdeckt darin ein altes Klassenfoto von Benjamin, auf dem auch seine junge Lehrerin Hillevi (Hanna Ullerstam) zu sehen ist. Iris und Jens (H√•kan Bengtsson) kennen Hillevi bereits, da sie auch an dem Orientierungslauf beteiligt war, in dessen Verlauf unlangst die Leiche im Wald gefunden wurde. Die Ermittler suchen die Lehrerin noch einmal auf und befragen sie zu ihrem Verhaltnis zu Benjamin. Hillevi beschreibt es als gut, aber rein professioneller Natur. Iris hat jedoch auf weiteren Fotos aus der Zeit ein Detail entdeckt, das darauf hindeutet, dass etwas mehr zwischen den beiden gewesen sein konnte. Die Polizistin nimmt Kontakt zu Benjamins Vater Fredrik (Joakim Sallquist) auf. Er erlaubt ihr, das Zimmer seines Sohnes zu durchsuchen. Dort stoSSt Iris auf ein verstecktes Polaroidfoto, das ihren Verdacht erhartet. Free-TV-Premiere</desc>

<desc>Nach der Befragung durch die Ermittler ist die Lehrerin Hillevi mit ihrem zwielichtigen neuen Freund zu einem Urlaub nach Jutland aufgebrochen. Iris und Jens heften sich an ihre Fersen. Die Polizisten machen Hillevis Hotel ausfindig. Sie ist offenbar von dem vermeintlichen "Peter", einem beruchtigten Heiratsschwindler, betrogen worden. Als Iris und Jens vor Ort in Danemark eintreffen, deutet alles auf einen Suizidversuch von Hillevi hin. Nachdem die Ermittler bei ihr waren, bricht die Lehrerin Hillevi (Hanna Ullerstam) spontan mit ihrem neuen Freund Peter (Johannes Lassen) zu einem Urlaub ins danische Jutland auf. Als sie morgens im Hotel aufwacht, ist ihr Begleiter mitsamt Geld und Auto verschwunden. Bei "Peter" handelt es sich in Wahrheit um einen polizeibekannten Heiratsschwindler, der schon mehrere Frauen geschadigt hat. Unterdessen durchsuchen Iris (Sofia Helin) und Jens (H√•kan Bengtsson) die Wohnung von Hillevi in Malmo und finden weitere Details uber das Verhaltnis zwischen dem verschwundenen Benjamin und seiner Lehrerin heraus. √úber die Auswertung von Kreditkartendaten ermitteln die Polizisten die Adresse des Hotels in Danemark, das Hillevi gebucht hatte. Iris und Jens machen sich auf den Weg dorthin und arbeiten vor Ort mit den heimischen Kollegen zusammen. Hillevi ist allerdings nicht auffindbar. Spuren in ihrem Hotelzimmer deuten darauf hin, dass sie Alkohol und Tabletten zu sich genommen hat. Iris entdeckt die Lehrerin schlieSSlich in der Nahe des Strandes. Hillevi lebt. Sie ist zwar benommen, kann aber schon wenig spater von den Ermittlern befragt werden. Bei Hillevis Ausfuhrungen zum Abend von Benjamins Verschwinden fallt Iris ein Detail auf, das sie noch einmal mit Alex (Love Linder) besprechen mochte. Doch als die Polizisten ihn in der Wohnung seines Vaters aufsuchen, lasst sich der junge Mann zu einer Kurzschlusshandlung hinreiSSen. Free-TV-Premiere Letzte Folge "Iris - Die Wahrheit"</desc>

Aber auch Wagners Ehefrau Susanne konnte ein Interesse daran haben, ihren Mann auSSer Gefecht zu setzen. SchlieSSlich hat Wagner die letzten Jahre im Gefangnis verbracht, weil er seine damals dreijahrige Tochter unter Drogeneinfluss schwer verletzt hatte.

Schnell ermitteln die Kommissare Sven Hansen und Anton Stadler Verdachtige: Anne Prachtl hatte als langjahrige Mitarbeiterin der "Grallinger Brauerei" auf den Posten der Geschaftsfuhrerin gehofft, doch dann wurde ihr Peter, der Sohn des Besitzers, vor die Nase gesetzt. Hat sie Grallinger auf dem Gewissen? Auch der alteingesessene Braumeister Josef Moosbach war mit dem Konzept seines neuen Chefs nicht einverstanden. Der ehrgeizige Grallinger wollte mit Unterstutzung von Gantings Burgermeister Karl Schretzmayer in der Traditionsbrauerei eine neue Produktpalette einfuhren: bunte Bierpops vom Fass. Moosbach hatte schlieSSlich gekundigt, weil der Streit mit Grallinger eskalierte, und ging zur Konkurrenzbrauerei von Claudia Sulldorf. Diese gibt zwar zunachst an, Peter Grallinger kaum gekannt zu haben, doch dann stellt sich heraus, dass sie ihm ein kaum abzulehnendes Angebot gemacht hatte. Ein interessanter Fall fur die Rosenheimer Kommissare.

<sub-title>Der Garten des Herrn Havel</sub-title>
<desc>Bei einem Einsatz als Notarztin wird Dr. Helene Sturbeck in das Haus der Krimiautorin Angelika Schmitt gerufen. Die achtjahrige Emilia liegt bewusstlos im Gastezimmer. Was ist passiert? Eigentlich wohnt Emilia in Frankfurt. Sie ist mit ihrem Vater Daniel Rossbach bei seiner Verlobten Lena Schmitt und deren Mutter Angelika zu Besuch. Emilia ist gegen √Ñpfel und Nusse allergisch und hat zum Fruhstuck Obstsalat gegessen. Ein anaphylaktischer Schock? Helene glaubt nicht daran. Sie vermutet, dass das Madchen vergiftet wurde. Aber wer wurde einem Kind so etwas antun? Oder war sie gar nicht das Ziel? Helene bringt Emilia in die Klinik und informiert Reuter. Ein Schnelltest von Rosi ergibt, dass der Obstsalat tatsachlich vergiftet wurde. Aber wie kam das Gift dort hinein und vor allem - wer sollte das Opfer sein? Angelika, Lena und Daniel waren alle drei im Haus und hatten Zugang zur Kuche. Drei mogliche Tater - und drei potenzielle Opfer. Vier, wenn tatsachlich Emilia Ziel des Anschlags war. Auch Nachbar Jurgen Havel ruckt ins Visier der Ermittler. Er hasst Angelika Schmitt wegen eines Rechtsstreits um den Garten - den er verloren hat. Zudem ist Havel der SOKO nicht unbekannt. Da gab es mal einen ominosen Fall vor drei Jahren, an den sich keiner im Team gern erinnert. Die Folge ist bereits eine Woche vor der Ausstrahlung in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar.</desc>

<sub-title>Meine offene Rechnung mit Corona</sub-title>
<desc>Funf Jahre nach dem Ausbruch von Corona in Deutschland haben sehr viele Menschen immer noch "Puls", wenn sie an die Zeit zuruckdenken. Und viele beschaftigen die Folgen der Pandemie bis heute. Ausgangssperren, Maskenpflicht, die Impfdebatte und naturlich das Virus selbst haben in der Gesellschaft Spuren hinterlassen. Sarah Tacke spricht mit den Menschen daruber, welche Rechnung sie mit Corona offen haben und wie die Pandemie ihr Leben verandert hat. Wahrend die Politik noch immer uneins ist, wie die Coronazeit aufgearbeitet werden soll, und Entscheidungen vertagt werden, erlebt Sarah Tacke, dass das Virus in der Erinnerung der Menschen noch sehr prasent ist. Das ZDF hat fur "Am Puls" einen Aufruf gestartet. √úber Social Media, TV-Sendungen und die "ZDFmitreden"-Community waren die Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer aufgefordert, von ihren offenen Rechnungen mit Corona zu berichten. Weit uber 1000 Menschen haben sich gemeldet. Wie brutal Corona das Leben verandern kann, erfahrt Sarah Tacke etwa von Fabian Fritz. 37 Jahre alt, kerngesund, sportlich, sollte er seine Professur fur Soziale Arbeit antreten. Er stand mitten im Leben, auf dem Hohepunkt seiner Karriere. Dann kam Corona und veranderte alles - bis heute. Er hat ME/CFS - die schlimmste Form von Long Covid. Von einem Moment auf den anderen platzten seine Traume, und er musste zuruck ins Kinderzimmer ziehen. Seine Krankheit fesselt ihn die meiste Zeit ans Bett, seine Familie pflegt ihn. Auch das Leben von Sabine BuSS wurde durch Corona auf den Kopf gestellt. Sie hatte zwei Modegeschafte, der Lockdown aber zwang sie, ihre Laden zu schlieSSen. "Man steht da und denkt: Ja und jetzt? Wo kommt das Geld her?", erzahlt Sabine BuSS. "Warum hat man uns die Laden einfach zugemacht? Warum hat man nicht gesagt, wir machen weiter mit Maske, mit Kontrolle, ob man geimpft ist oder nicht geimpft ist?", fragt sie sich. Ihr Traum von der eigenen Boutique wurde durch Corona zum Albtraum - noch heute kampft sie mit den finanziellen und emotionalen Folgen. Sarah Tacke begegnet auf ihrer Reise Menschen, die das Vertrauen in die Politik und in die Medien verloren haben - die von der sogenannten "Querdenkerszene" aufgefangen wurden. Andere haben erlebt, wie sich ihre Familien und Freundeskreise uber die Impfdebatte zerstritten haben. Sarah Tacke erfahrt, welche Wunden in der Gesellschaft bis heute klaffen. Maskenpflicht, SchulschlieSSungen, Ausgangssperren - was war notwendig, was im Nachhinein betrachtet zu viel? Mit vielen Fragen im Gepack reist sie ins politische Berlin und konfrontiert dort die Verantwortlichen. Die Dokumentation ist Teil der Reihe "Am Puls", in der bildschirmbekannte ZDF-Presenter den Themen nachgehen, die Deutschland bewegen. Sie horen zu, tauchen in den Alltag der Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer ein und beleuchten, welche Auswirkungen die Entscheidungen der Politik auf das Leben in allen Teilen der Gesellschaft haben. Und was dringend verbessert werden muss. Mehr unter https://ampuls.zdf.de</desc>

<title>Die Elon-Musk-Story</title>
<sub-title>Die Elon-Musk-Story: Superreich und supermachtig?</sub-title>
<desc>Elon Musk ist der reichste Mensch der Welt - und polarisiert wie kaum jemand sonst. Viele furchten ihn als manischen Narzissten mit Hass auf alles, was woke, queer oder allzu demokratisch ist. Von seinen Anhangern wird Elon Musk vergottert als Konig der Nerds, als Erfinder, der die Welt verandert. Musk verschiebt die Grenzen des technisch Machbaren, aber auch des Sagbaren. Wahrend sein Unternehmen SpaceX die erste wiederverwendbare Rakete baut, hetzt Musk auf seinem Social-Media-Kanal X gegen Migranten, trommelt fur die AfD und andere Parteien am rechten Rand in Europa. Dabei attackiert er gerne auch demokratisch gewahlte Regierungen. Wie radikal denkt dieser Exzentriker wirklich? Was hat ihn gepragt? Und wie gefahrlich ist er fur die demokratische westliche Welt? Eine Spurensuche fuhrt die Autoren Carolin Heise und Tristan Sohngen in sein Geburtsland Sudafrika, ins Silicon Valley und nach Boca Chica in Texas. Interviews mit seinem Vater Errol Musk zeigen, in welchem harten Umfeld Musk junior aufwuchs. Schon fruh muss er sich gegen jugendliche Schlager behaupten. Und, laut eigener Aussage, auch gegen seinen Vater, der ihn und seinen Bruder Kimbal mit verbaler und korperlicher Gewalt erzog. Vater Errol bestreitet das im Gesprach und erzahlt seine eigene Version der Geschichte. Im Silicon Valley entwickelt sich Musk zum waghalsigen Unternehmer, der immer alles auf eine Karte setzt. Risiko-Kapitalgeber Carsten Maschmeyer oder der Ex-VW-Chef Herbert Diess erklaren, wie Musk seine Firmen mit nahezu manischer Intensitat zum Erfolg treibt - und so das Fundament legt fur seinen heutigen Einfluss auf die Welt. Musk kann nicht nur die Massen beeinflussen und hat finanziell nahezu unerschopfliche Ressourcen. Sondern er beherrscht mit dem Satelliten-Netzwerk Starlink auch modernste Tech-Infrastruktur und verfugt seit der US-Wahl auch uber politische Macht. Als enger Trump-Vertrauter soll Musk US-Regierungsausgaben uberwachen und kurzen. Der ehemalige Verteidigungsminister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg oder der Sicherheitsexperte Frank Sauer ordnen Musks Machtfulle ein, die mittlerweile historisches AusmaSS erreicht hat. Mit analytischem Blick schaut die Dokumentation zudem auf Musks digitales Abbild: sein X-Account. Dort postet Musk unablassig, an manchen Tagen bis zu 15 mal in der Stunde. Er interagiert mit rechtsextremen Accounts, teilt Verschworungstheorien - und mischt sich in die deutsche Bundespolitik ein, indem er Staatsoberhaupt und Kanzler beleidigt, die AfD lobt. Sein Biograf erzahlt, wie Musk nahezu suchtig ist nach der hyperpolarisierenden digitalen Welt seines eigenen sozialen Netzwerks. Fur viele Beobachter wie die Publizistin Marina Weisband agiert Musk auf der Plattform diktatorisch - und radikalisiert sich in immer schnellerem AusmaSS. Fur sie ist er gemeinsam mit Donald Trump die gefahrlichste Person unserer Zeit.</desc>

<desc>Millionenbetrug mit Testzentren Das Corona-Desaster Coronatests sollten wahrend der Pandemie helfen, das Infektionsgeschehen unter Kontrolle zu halten. √úberall im ganzen Land entstanden in Windeseile Testzentren. √úberprufungen, ob Abrechnungsdaten stimmten, gab es anfangs kaum. Diese Situation nutzten auch Kriminelle und Betruger, in wenigen Wochen wurde manch einer zum Millionar. Den Schaden durch Abrechnungsbetrug schatzen Experten auf 1,7 Milliarden Euro. Callcenter-Abzocke Perfide Jagd auf deutsche Anleger Die neueste Abzockfalle, in die Zehntausende deutsche Kleinanleger tappen, heiSSt Cybertrading. Sie gilt aktuell als die bedeutendste Form von Internetbetrug - mit Schaden in Milliardenhohe. "frontal" ist mit einem internationalen Rechercheteam den Abzockern auf der Spur - sie reicht von Nordrhein-Westfalen bis ins georgische Tiflis. Neue Schulden mit alten Mehrheiten Wie CDU und SPD die Grunen umgarnen Im Wahlkampf hatten sich Friedrich Merz und die Union fur Haushaltsdisziplin und Schuldenbremse ausgesprochen. Nach der Wahl soll diese nun aufgeweicht werden und ein 500 Milliarden Euro schweres Sondervermogen fur Investitionen kommen. Fur das Vorhaben brauchen die schwarz-roten Koalitionsverhandler allerdings die Grunen, doch die zieren sich.</desc>

<title>Da geht was, Deutschland!</title>
<sub-title>Wer starkt unsere Demokratie?</sub-title>
<desc>Demokratie muss nicht alt, steif und verstaubt sein. Egal ob Jungpolitiker, Influencerin oder Kulturverein - sie alle geben der Demokratie einen neuen Look. Demokratie gestalten und erlebbarer machen, das gelingt mit Events auf dem Land, Videos im Netz und Festivals in der Stadt. Fur "plan b" geht Reporterin Antonia Lilly Schanze auf die Suche nach Menschen, die mit ihren Ideen unser demokratisches System starken. "Ich weiSS nicht, wie es vielen geht, aber ich hatte keinen guten Politikunterricht", so Sally Lisa Starken. Deswegen ging die Content Kreatorin aus Bielefeld selber auf die Antwortsuche. Nun will sie mit ihrer Vision "politikwach" machen. Dabei setzt sie sich fur politische Aufklarung ein. Und das macht die 33-Jahrige mit uber 90.000 Instagram-Followern schon ziemlich gut: Auf Instagram, TikTok und im Podcast erklart sie einfach und verstandlich politische Hintergrunde und ordnet aktuelle News ein. Mit ihrem politischen Kinderbuch erklart sie den Jungsten die Grundprinzipien der Demokratie und auf verschiedenen Buhnen spricht sie daruber, wie wir unsere Demokratie erhalten und starken konnen. In Zwickau, einer Stadt, die vom demografischen Wandel betroffen und rechte Ideologie langst in der Mitte der Gesellschaft angekommen ist, leistet der gemeinnutzige Verein "Alter Gasometer" eine demokratische Mammutaufgabe. Mittendrin Matthias Bley. Der 37-Jahrige sieht sich als Netzwerker und Motivator, der junge Menschen, die Zivilgesellschaft und Vereine darin bestarkt, die Stadt Zwickau zu einem lebens- und liebenswerten Ort zu machen. Mit niedrigschwelligen Angeboten wie Musikveranstaltungen, Poetryslams und Festivals mochte der Verein demokratische Werte und die Jugendbeteiligung starken. Letzteres gelingt ihm auch durch einen Jugendbeirat, der den Zwickauer Stadtrat berat. Demokratie passiert nicht nur irgendwo in den Parlamenten, sondern beginnt direkt vor Ort in den Kommunen. Das weiSS auch der 24-jahrige Jungpolitiker Luca Piwodda. Seine Vision: Den landlichen Raum attraktiv gestalten und junge Menschen fur Politik begeistern. Und fur diese Vision setzt er sich mit vollem Engagement ein. Schon wahrend seines Studiums grundet Luca eine eigene Partei und spater auch einen Kulturverein. Durch sein politisches Engagement fallt er auf und wird einer der ersten geforderten Talente der Organisation JoinPolitics. Dieses Jahr kandidiert Luca sogar fur den Kreistag Uckermark und als Burgermeister fur seine Heimatstadt Gartz (Oder). Warum er kandidiert, konnte man pure Heimatliebe nennen: "Hier wohne ich, hier will ich mich einfach wohlfuhlen. Dazu gehort es auch, dass es vorangeht und nicht alles auf der Stelle tritt." Beide Teile "plan b: Da geht was, Deutschland!" sind ab 20. August 2024 in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar.</desc>

<desc>Zwischen Leben und Tod! Was aussieht wie eine Wohnungsdurchsuchung, wird fur Melanie und Mattes zu einem Wettlauf gegen die Zeit. Denn Melanie ist auf den Zunder einer Landmine getreten. Was will Ex-Soldat und Wohnungsinhaber Kaminski mit diesem Nervenkrieg bezwecken? Warum hat er die beiden Beamten in diese grausame Falle gelockt? Bald wird klar, Kaminski verlangt endlich die Gerechtigkeit, die ihm als Kriegsversehrtem eigentlich zusteht. Melanie und Mattes geraten an die Grenzen ihrer seelischen Belastbarkeit. Wahrend die beiden in der Wohnung Alex Kaminskis auf das Bombenentscharfungskommando warten mussen, kommen sie sich so nah wie selten zuvor. Dass nur Kaminski selbst die Bombe entscharfen kann, lasst ihre Situation noch auswegloser erscheinen. Kaminski will erzwingen, das Gutachten eines Psychologen uber ihn zu andern, da es fur ihn und seine Familie verheerende Folgen hatte. Melanie beweist in diesem brisanten Fall um einen Kriegsveteranen ihre uneingeschrankte Kompetenz als Polizistin, und auch Mattes ist bereit, fur seine Kollegin alles zu riskieren.</desc>

<title>Zehn Tage allein mit Papa</title>
<desc>Isabelle, Antoine und ihre Kinder bekommen unerwartet einen Luxusskiurlaub geschenkt. Doch als Isabelle aus beruflichen Grunden daheimbleibt, artet der Trip unter Papas Aufsicht vollends aus. Antoine verbannt die Kinder zwar schnell in den Skiunterricht, jedoch bringen ein verhasster Ex-Kollege sowie das Liebesinteresse einer Fremden den auf Skiern talentfreien Vater anderweitig ins Wanken. - Fortsetzung der Erfolgskomodie "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" Familie Mercier hat sich fortschrittlich organisiert: Wahrend Isabelle (Aure Atika) vor kurzem eine Anwaltskanzlei gegrundet hat, kummert sich Antoine (Franck Dubosc) als Hausmann um die Kinder Arthur (Swan Joulin), Chloe (Violette Guillon), Maxime (Ilan Debrabant) und Jojo (Evan Paturel). Auf Einladung von Steevy (Bertrand Uzeel), dem neuen Ehemann von Isabelles Schwester Audrey (Helena Noguerra), erhalt die Familie die Chance zu einem Luxusskiurlaub in Courchevel. Doch als bei Isabelle am Abreisetag ihr lang ersehnter erster Gerichtsfall eingeht, bleibt die Mutter kurzfristig zu Hause. Hilflos macht sich Antoine alleine mit den Kindern auf, die das Luxuskettenhotel aus der Familie ihres neuen Schwagers schnell auf den Kopf zu stellen wissen. Zwar kann Antoine seinen Nachwuchs tagsuber in der angeschlossenen Skischule abgeben, doch neben seinen eigenen, ungelenken Fahrversuchen muss sich der Familienvater plotzlich mit einem alten Bekannten herumschlagen. Sein groSSspuriger Ex-Arbeitskollege Thierry Di Caprio (Alexis Michalik) will vor Ort mit Immobiliengeschaften einen neuen Sektor fur seinen Arbeitgeber erschlieSSen. Antoine entwickelt den Wunsch, selbst wieder Geld zu verdienen. Daruber hinaus hat die alleinstehende Laure (Annelise Hesme) ein Auge auf Antoine geworfen, was auch der Nachzuglerin Isabelle nicht vorenthalten bleibt. Nach "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" landete der franzosische Regisseur Ludovic Bernard in seiner Heimat auch mit der Fortsetzung "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" einen Kinoerfolg, wenngleich er dieses Mal nicht die Millionenmarke bei den Zuschauern knacken konnte. Gedreht wurde die Familienkomodie in dem bekannten Skigebiet Courchevel. Im Presseheft des Films beschreibt Bernard den Dreh als beinahe Urlaubserfahrung. So wurde auch in Drehpausen fleiSSig Ski gefahren oder die eine oder andere Schneeballschlacht ausgefochten. Stilistisch macht sich "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" sein im Vergleich zu seinem Vorgangerfilm gewandeltes Setting ebenfalls zunutze, denn der Film kommt noch slapstickhafter daher und schopft dabei das (korperliche) Potenzial seines Wintersportambiente voll aus.

So wird aus einer alten, schmucklosen Kinderwiege ein bunter Eyecatcher, ein 4-Karat-Ring verwandelt sich in zwei neue Schmuckstucke, und ein Paar alte Ski werden zu einem ausgefallenen Tisch upgecycelt.</desc>
