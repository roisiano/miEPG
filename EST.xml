So hat sie sich hinter den Kulissen jahrelang den Wunschen der chinesischen Zensur gebeugt. Filme mit Themen, die Missfallen erregen konnten, wurden erst gar nicht produziert. In keinem modernen Thriller darf China mehr der Bosewicht sein.

<desc>Auf den ersten Blick wirken Leyla und Tristan wie ein gluckliches Paar. Gemeinsam reisen sie zu einer abgelegenen Insel, auf die Leylas Jugendfreundin Stella sie eingeladen hat. Schon bei der Ankunft zeigt sich: Hier geschehen ratselhafte Dinge. Zahlreiche Paare kommen in den letzten Sommertagen zusammen, um die Welt durch die Augen eines anderen Menschen zu sehen. Fur die einen ist es eine Suche nach sich selbst, fur die anderen eine Flucht. Bei einem gemeinsamen festlichen Abendessen treffen Leyla und Tristan auf Fabienne und Mo. Gemeinsam begehen sie das Tauschritual und erfahren, wie sich dadurch ihre Wahrnehmungen und damit auch ihr Verhalten, ihr Verlangen und ihre Beziehungen verandern. Besonders Leyla ist glucklich, sie fuhlt sich erlost und erfullt von einem vollig neuen Lebensgefuhl. Als sie sich weigert, zu ihrem alten Ich zuruckzukehren, gerat die Situation auSSer Kontrolle ... Der Film erforscht tiefgreifende Fragen nach Identitat und Selbstwahrnehmung und feierte 2022 seine Weltpremiere bei den Filmfestspielen von Venedig, wo er auch gleich den 16. Queer Lion gewann. Beim Filmfest Hamburg 2022 wurde die Produktion von Tobias Walker und Philipp Worm auSSerdem mit dem Produzentenpreis in der Kategorie Deutsche Kinoproduktionen ausgezeichnet.</desc>

<sub-title>Sakurajima: Unter der Asche des Riesen</sub-title>
<desc>Der japanische Vulkan Sakurajima ist fast taglich aktiv und stellt eine akute Gefahr fur die 600.000 in seinem Radius lebenden Menschen dar. Das wohl eindrucklichste Beispiel fur die Bedrohung zeigte sich 1914: Eine gigantische Aschewolke stieg aus dem Krater, enorme Lavamassen ergossen sich uber die Flanken des Vulkans - die groSSte Vulkankatastrophe Japans im 20. Jahrhundert. Doch aufgrund der hohen Bevolkerungsdichte und des Vulkanreichtums hatten die Japaner gar keine andere Wahl, als auch Zonen in der Nahe solcher Feuerriesen zu besiedeln. Jeden Tag treten die Dorfbewohner zum GroSSputz auf die StraSSe, da der Vulkan Unmengen an Asche ausstoSSt - im Jahr bis zu 30 Tonnen. Das ist zwar lastig, bringt aber auch Vorteile: Die Vulkanasche dungt den Boden, so dass an den Hangen des Sakurajima die groSSten Rettiche der Welt wachsen. Aufgrund der standigen Aktivitat ist der Krater nicht zuganglich, doch die Forscher brauchen Informationen, um Eruptionen vorauszusehen. Arnaud trifft Masato Iguchi, der ihm eine weltweit einmalige Methode prasentiert: Um dem Zentrum des Geschehens so nahe wie moglich zu kommen, wurde ein Tunnel zum Inneren des Vulkans gebaut. So konnen die Bewegungen des Magmas praktisch vor Ort beobachtet werden. Im Falle einer groSSeren Eruption mussen jedoch Tausende Menschen in Rekordzeit in Sicherheit gebracht werden, deswegen finden jahrliche Evakuierungsubungen statt - ein Ernstfalltraining, das enorme logistische und menschliche Ressourcen erfordert. Trotz der groSSen Gefahren haben die Menschen es geschafft, sich mit dem turbulenten Sakurajima zu arrangieren. Sie leben ihr Leben - den rauchenden Vulkankrater stets im Blick.</desc>

<desc>Im Herzen des philippinischen Archipels erheben sich auf der Insel Bohol 1268 majestatische kakaobraune Hugel, die Chocolate Hills, auch Schokoladenhugel genannt. Sie bilden eine der schonsten Landschaften der Erde, die seit 2006 zum UNESCO-Welterbe zahlt. Die Insel wurde erst vor zwei Millionen Jahren vom asiatischen Kontinent abgetrennt und beherbergt eine einzigartige Flora und Fauna. Im Untergrund der Insel liegen uber 1400 Hohlen, in denen 35 Fledertierarten leben. Bohol beheimatet aber nicht nur das groSSte Fledertier der Welt (den Goldkronen-Flughund), sondern auch den kleinsten Primaten (den Philippinen-Koboldmaki), einen Riesengleiter (den Philippinen-Gleitflieger) sowie hunderte Vogel- und Affenarten. Der jadegrune Fluss Loboc schlangelt sich durch die jahrhundertealten Walder und mundet schlieSSlich ins Meer. Die nahrstoffreichen Gewasser versorgen dabei die Tiere und Pflanzen der Mangrovenwalder und Korallenriffe. Im Meer vor Bohol lebt eine Vielzahl von Schildkroten-, Wasserschlangen-, Fisch- und Haiarten, wie beispielsweise der Fuchshai. Mittlerweile wird das fragile √ñkosystem Bohols allerdings durch Entwaldung, Dynamitfischerei und landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken bedroht, die immer starker in den Lebensraum der Tiere eingreifen.</desc>

An der C√¥te Bleue bekommt Journalistin Clemence Fournival von Koch Yvan Vahanian ein Dreigangemenu rund um die Bouillabaisse serviert. Der Geograf und Ernahrungswissenschaftler Pierre Raffard erklart, woher die Bouillabaisse eigentlich stammt, wie sie sich verbreitete und welche Rolle sie in der franzosischen Kultur spielt. (2): Kulinarische Mitbringsel Journalistin Clemence Fournival geht provenzalische Produkte einkaufen: Pommes aus Kichererbsen (panisses), Olivenpasten (tapenades) und eine Zitronenlimonade (PAC Citron), die an heiSSen Tagen fur Erfrischung sorgt. (3): Ran an die Topfe! Appetit bekommen? Hier gibt es ein einfaches Bouillabaisse-Rezept, das sich leicht nachkochen lasst. Also: Ran an die Topfe! ______________________ Rezept fur Bouillabaisse: Die traditionelle Fischsuppe aus Marseille bringt provenzalisches Flair auf den Teller.

Ein Kunstler zeichnete sie einst pausenlos, um seine eigene Behinderung zu vergessen: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec malte, was ihm selbst durch seine schwere Knochenerkrankung verwehrt blieb. Sein einzigartiger Pinselstrich und sein Blick fur das Besondere verewigten das feierlustige Paris zu Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts auf Plakaten und Gemalden. (2): In Australien: Wie ein Bumerang Das L-formige Wurfobjekt fasziniert jeden, der es in die Hande nimmt. Ein Bumerang ist weit mehr als ein Spielzeug: Er symbolisiert sowohl die Tradition der australischen Ureinwohner als auch die Aneignung des Landes durch die WeiSSen. Wer sich zum Bumerang bekennt, zeigt seine Angehorigkeit zum australischen Volk. (3): In Taiwan: Huhnchensuppe mit wildem Pfeffer von Tapas Im einsamen Bergdorf Lixing bereitet Tapas ein traditionelles Gericht zu. Ihr Nachbar zerlegt ein Huhnchen fur sie, das sie in kochendes Wasser taucht: Krallen, Kopf, Flugel - das ganze Huhn landet im Kochtopf. Mit Ingwer und wildem Pfeffer verfeinert kochelt die Suppe. Serviert wird sie mit gestampften Klebreis. (4): Marokkos unbarmherziger Sultan Die Kaiserstadt Mekn√®s ist seit dem 17. Jahrhundert fur ihre Palaste und Mauern beruhmt.

<desc>(1): Toskana: Heimat von Pinocchio Pinocchio ist das Geschopf von Meister Geppetto - und der bitterbosen Vorstellungswelt des toskanischen Schriftstellers Carlo Collodi (1826-1890). Sein 1883 erschienenes Buch hat mit der Filmversion von Walt Disney aus dem Jahr 1940 nur wenig gemein, denn anders als die frohliche Zeichentrickmarionette, die sich lieber amusiert anstatt zur Schule zu gehen, erwacht Collodis Pinocchio in einer grausamen Gesellschaft zum Leben, in der Ungerechtigkeit und Elend herrschen. Dank ihrer universellen Botschaft zahlt die Coming-of-Age-Story, die in mehr als 200 Sprachen ubersetzt wurde, zu den meistverkauften italienischen Buchern der Welt. (2): New York: Im Kreuzfeuer der Graffiti-Sprayer Graffiti kann vieles sein: ein dekorativer Farbtupfer im tristen GroSSstadtgrau, der Wunsch, sich an einer Mauer zu verewigen, oder auch ein Ausdruck des Protests gegen Ungerechtigkeiten. Was in New York einst als vandaischer Auswuchs einer orientierungslosen Jugend abgetan wurde, hat sich uber die Jahre zu einer eigenstandigen Kunstdisziplin entwickelt. Wahrend Graffiti fruher fur Gewalt und Elend stand, genieSSt es heute ein hohes Ansehen und gilt als ein Symbol der Gentrifizierung, die in New Yorks ehemaligen Arbeitervierteln Einzug gehalten hat.

<sub-title>Unzen: Der Gefahr zum Trotz</sub-title>
<desc>200 Jahre lang schlummerte der Unzen im auSSersten Sudwesten Japans, bevor er sich 1991 nachdrucklich zuruckmeldete. In den folgenden funf Jahren spuckte er uber 10.000 pyroklastische Strome aus, die immense Schaden verursachten. Die 400 Grad heiSSen Lawinen aus Gas und vulkanischer Asche rasten zusammen mit Lavabrocken die Vulkanhange hinunter und vernichteten alles im Umkreis von mehreren Kilometern. Doch mit dem Ende der Eruptionen war die Gefahr noch nicht gebannt: Die Ausbruche hinterlieSSen uber 200 Millionen Tonnen vulkanisches Material, das bei heftigen Regenfallen noch immer mitgerissen wird. Daraus konnen Schlammstrome, sogenannte Lahars, entstehen, die sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit von bis zu 100 Stundenkilometer ihren Weg ins Tal walzen. Doch statt zu resignieren, bieten die Japaner dem aggressiven Vulkan die Stirn. Nach dem letzten Ausbruch veranlassten die Behorden den Bau eines Dammsystems. Bis heute dauern die Arbeiten an, denn es ist keine gewohnliche Baustelle: Das komplette Gebiet ist Gefahrenzone - Zutritt strengstens verboten. Der Baustellenleiter, Herr Matsui, zeigt Arnaud, wie dort gearbeitet werden kann, ohne dass ein Mensch die Baustelle betritt. Wie in einem Videospiel werden die Baumaschinen aus sicherem Abstand via Fernbedienung gesteuert - in dieser GroSSenordnung eine einzigartige Technik. Trotz allem ist die Sicherheit in dem Gebiet keineswegs garantiert - doch die Menschen haben gelernt die unvorhersehbaren Launen der Natur als Bestandteil ihres Alltags zu akzeptieren. Auch wenn der Unzen noch so tobt - die Menschen zu seinen FuSSen werden nicht weichen.</desc>

Die "Feinde des Volkes" wurden mit ihren Frauen und Kindern abtransportiert. Die litauische Schriftstellerin Jurga Vilƒó erzahlt ihre Geschichte in der Graphic Novel Sibiro Haiku. Sie beschreibt darin den langen Weg der Angst, des Hungers und der Trennung aus der Perspektive ihres Vaters, damals ein Kind.

Die energiegeladene Musikrichtung zehrt von den kulturellen Wurzeln des beschaulichen nordischen Landes und hat sich zum Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks entwickelt. In den 1980er-Jahren traf der im Vereinigten Konigreich entstandene Metal auf ein Finnland, das von seinen sowjetischen Nachbarn nicht nur politisch isoliert gehalten wurde.

Um seiner Drohung Nachdruck zu verleihen, sprengt er bereits eine der Bomben. Die britische Regierung weigert sich, auf die Erpressung einzugehen, und ein Team von Sprengstoffexperten unter der Leitung von Lieutenant Anthony Fallon wird auf das Schiff entsandt, um die Sprengsatze zu entscharfen. Doch bereits die √úberfahrt auf dem sturmgepeitschten Atlantik fordert erste Opfer. Die Zunder der Bomben erweisen sich als kompliziert - bei jeder falschen Bewegung droht eine Explosion. Wahrend Fallon und sein Team einen verzweifelten Kampf gegen die Zeit fuhren, ubernimmt Scotland Yard die Ermittlungen an Land. Inspektor John McCleod leitet die Fahndung nach dem Erpresser, motiviert durch die Tatsache, dass auch seine eigene Familie an Bord der "Britannic" ist.

<sub-title>Kongo: Schutz fur den Gorillawald</sub-title>
<desc>In den riesigen Regenwaldern im Norden der Republik Kongo geschieht etwas AuSSergewohnliches: Hier arbeiten Holzfaller, die den Wald nicht zerstoren, sondern durch ihre Arbeit zum Erhalt der Tropenwalder und ihrer Artenvielfalt beitragen. Dieses kleine Wunder gelingt, weil sich zwei Holzfirmen verpflichtet haben, in ihren Waldern eine nachhaltige Forstwirtschaft zu betreiben - immerhin auf einer Flache halb so groSS wie die Schweiz. Noch nicht mal ein Baum pro Hektar wird dort gefallt. Besonders artenreiche Zonen bleiben sogar vollstandig von den Kettensagen der Holzfaller verschont. Mehr als ein Viertel der gesamten Waldflache steht daher unter Schutz. Diese selektive Holznutzung hilft der Tierwelt: 70.000 Gorillas leben allein im Wald des Holzunternehmens IFO ‚Äî mehr als irgendwo sonst. Ihre Bestande bleiben seit Jahren stabil. Fur die Holzfirmen zahlt sich der schonende Umgang mit der Natur aus, denn die Walder erholen sich vom Holzeinschlag und konnen auch in Zukunft genutzt werden. Auch die Menschen in einer der armsten Regionen Zentralafrikas profitieren. Die Holzindustrie schafft dringend benotigte Arbeitsplatze, sorgt fur sauberes Trinkwasser und eine Gesundheitsversorgung. Die Bewohner im Norden der Republik Kongo haben erkannt, dass sich der Schutz der Regenwalder auch wirtschaftlich lohnt.

<sub-title>Schweiz: Einsatz fur die Alpenwiesen</sub-title>
<desc>Die Schweizer Alpen sind eine der grandiosesten Landschaften der Welt. Es gibt hier eine enorme Vielfalt an Tier- und Pflanzenarten. Neben Gamsen und Murmeltieren findet man seltene Pflanzen wie EdelweiSS und Enzian. Im Sommer verwandeln sich die Almen in ein buntes Blumenmeer. Fur viele ist diese Bergwelt "Natur pur". Doch dieses Almwiesenparadies stammt aus Menschenhand. Nur weil Bergbauern seit Jahrhunderten ihr Vieh in die Berge treiben, konnte dieses besondere Mosaik aus Wiesen, Waldern und Felsen entstehen. Ohne Beweidung wurden die Wiesen in wenigen Jahrzehnten von Gebusch und Wald uberwuchert werden. Pflanzen, Insekten und Vogelarten wurden verschwinden, Natur und Urlaubslandschaft gingen verloren. Und genau diese Entwicklung droht. Das Leben der Bergbauern ist hart, viele geben ihre Hofe auf. Andere bleiben, treiben aber die Tiere im Sommer nicht mehr auf die Alm. Der Wald dringt immer weiter vor. Doch die Schweizer haben die Gefahr erkannt und lassen sich einiges einfallen, um ihre zauberhafte Bergwelt zu erhalten. Der Film begleitet die Hirtin Lean, die mit 900 Schafen den Sommer hoch oben in den Bergen so verbringt wie Schafer vor Hunderten von Jahren. Er zeigt, was die Schweizer alles tun, um ihre alten Traditionen zu erhalten. Staatliche Fordergelder fur die Almbauern gehoren genauso dazu wie die Wolle der Schweizer Schafe, die seit einigen Jahren wieder vermarktet wird. Es geht darum, neue Wege zu finden, um die einzigartige Landschaft der Schweizer Alpen auch in Zukunft zu erhalten.</desc>

<desc>Die funf Elemente Holz, Feuer, Erde, Metall und Wasser gelten als Grundbausteine fur alles im Universum. Ein Konzept, das noch heute das tagliche Leben der Menschen im modernen China beeinflusst und auch weltweit enorm popular geworden ist. Grun ist die Farbe des Holz-Elements, es steht fur den Osten, Kindheit, Vitalitat und den Fruhling. An den Hangen der Dongting-Berge ist der Fruhling die wichtigste Zeit des Jahres. Das milde Klima hier im Osten des Landes nahe Shanghai ist ideal fur einen beruhmten grunen Tee: Biluochun. Die besten Blatter landen in den Lehmofen des Teemeisters Yan Jielong - aber erst das Zusammenspiel aller funf Elemente macht den Tee perfekt: In Erde gewachsen und vom Wasser genahrt, wird der Tee geerntet - Holz wird fur das Feuer benotigt, in einer Metallpfanne wird der Tee gerostet, wodurch sich der Kreis schlieSSt. Grun ist die Farbe des Neubeginns in China. Wahrend Tee im Fruhjahr geerntet wird, wird eine andere Nutzpflanze in dieser Zeit ausgesat: Reis. Auf den Terrassen im Suden der Provinz Yunnan bestellt das Volk der Hani mit Wasserbuffeln die Felder fur die Aussaat - so wie seit hunderten von Jahren. Ein stetiger Kreislauf.

<desc>"Kreislauf der funf Elemente" - so wird eine chinesische Lehre genannt, die den Kreislauf der Natur und des Lebens beschreibt. Darin gibt es funf Phasen, jede davon ist mit einer Farbe verbunden. Grun ist das Holz-Element, was fur den Neubeginn nach dem Winter steht. Das Feuer-Element ist Rot, es steht fur die Hitze, den Sommer, die dynamische Kraft der Jugend und Feierlichkeiten. Einst wurde alles rot geschmuckt, wenn der Kaiser eine Opferzeremonie abhielt. Rot wie das Blut. Heute ist Rot zur Farbe der Freude und des Glucks geworden. Bei Familie Cheng in der historischen Kleinstad Pingyao laufen die Vorbereitungen fur das Neujahrsfest mit Hochdruck.

Mit etwas roter Deko werden daraus Glucksbrotchen fur die ganze Familie - das neue Jahr kann beginnen. Auch in der chinesischen Kuche haben Farben eine groSSe Bedeutung: Rote Nahrung gilt z.B. als gut fur Herz und Dunndarm. Besonders beliebt sind rote Chilischoten. China stellt die Halfte der Weltproduktion an Chili her. Die Schoten trocknen in kilometerlagen Reihen in der Wuste am FuSSe des Tianshan Gebirges.

<title>Jetset - Die goldene √Ñra der Luftfahrt</title>
<desc>Lange vor Klimakrise und Flugscham gilt das Fliegen als Inbegriff von Luxus, Freiheit und Weltoffenheit. Seit den 1950er-Jahren erlebt die Luftfahrt einen epochalen Wandel. Technologische Meisterleistungen wie die Lockheed Super Constellation setzen neue MaSSstabe fur Geschwindigkeit und Komfort. Internationale Reisen werden schneller, luxurioser und die Ziele exotischer. Fliegen wird zum Symbol fur Glamour, Piloten und Stewardessen zu Helden des Himmels. Edeltraud Lioba Miller, ehemalige Stewardess bei Pan Am, erinnert sich: "Pan Am war der Inbegriff von Glanz und Glamour. Bei uns war der Jet Set zu Hause." Die Stewardess wird zum Aushangeschild der Airlines, ihre Uniformen zum Symbol der √Ñra. Heute London, morgen Paris, ubermorgen New York - das Leben der "Jetsetter". Die Concorde verkorpert den Hohepunkt dieser √Ñra. Sie uberquert den Atlantik in nur dreieinhalb Stunden und definiert Eleganz und Exklusivitat neu. Jean Louis Chatelain, Concorde-Pilot, beschreibt sie als "technisches Wunder". An Bord genieSSen Passagiere Champagner, Kaviar und edelste Weine. Nicole Meneveux, ehemalige Concorde-Stewardess, schwarmt: "Concorde war ein Drei-Sterne-Restaurant bei doppelter Schallgeschwindigkeit." Doch in den 1980er-Jahren endet die √Ñra des exklusiven High-Society-Privileges. GroSSraum-Jets wie die Boeing 747 machen das Fliegen massentauglich und Tickets erschwinglicher. Die Faszination einer √Ñra, die die Welt und den Himmel veranderte, lebt nur als Erinnerung weiter. Der Glamour ist verschwunden, nun wird der rasant wachsende Luftverkehr zur Herausforderung fur die Zukunft.</desc>

Nur wenige konnten sich doppelte Schallgeschwindigkeit leisten: Geschaftsleute, Popstars und Luxusurlauber, denen es auf 10.000 Dollar nicht ankam.Die Katastrophe geschah am 25. Juli 2000 und wirft bis heute Fragen auf. 113 Menschen kamen dabei ums Leben. Nur wenige wissen, dass am Schicksalstag der Concorde zwei Flugzeuge von Paris aus nach New York starteten, weil es so viele Passagiere gab, die in New York eine Kreuzfahrt beginnen wollten. Die Reisegruppen konnten vorab zwischen den Concorde-Maschinen wechseln und umbuchen, was einige um ihr Leben brachte, wahrend andere ihres durch die Umbuchung retten konnten.Ein Hobbyfilmer filmte den ersten Flug. Er hatte seine Platze kurzfristig getauscht. Kurz nachdem seine Concorde in New York gelandet war, flog die zweite mit seinen Tauschpartnern in Paris los. Nur 133 Sekunden nach dem Start endete ihr Flug in der Katastrophe.Die Filmdokumentation erzahlt die wechselvolle Geschichte der Supersonic-Projekte und lasst auch die Konkurrenz nicht aus: Die Moskauer TU-144, auch "Konkordski" genannt, erlitt ein noch fruheres Ende als die Concorde.Langst gibt es Plane fur einen neuen √úberschall-Jet fur Passagiere.

Sie verfasst einen Artikel fur die Lokalzeitung, in dem sie die damalige Polizeiarbeit scharf kritisiert und Damtoft an den Pranger stellt. Trotz der feindseligen Reaktionen aus den Reihen der ortlichen Polizei und ihrer eigenen Kollegen verfolgt Nora den Fall unbeirrt weiter. Plotzlich steht nicht nur die Vergangenheit im Fokus, sondern auch die dringende Frage, ob Damtoft etwas mit dem Verschwinden der jungen Sofia zu tun hat, die wenige Tage zuvor nicht nach Hause kam ...</desc>

<sub-title>Norwegen: Ruckkehr zu den Enteninseln</sub-title>
<desc>Im Vega-Archipel, hoch im Norden Norwegens am Polarkreis, ist die Natur karg. Die Menschen lebten hier jahrhundertlang als Fischer und Bauern und sind mit wilden Eiderenten eine einmalige Partnerschaft eingegangen. Der Vega-Archipel mit seinen uber 6.000 Inseln ist das Reich der Eiderenten. Sie kommen jedes Jahr hierhin, um in den flachen Gewassern Nahrung zu finden und sich zu paaren. Doch auf den kahlen Inseln sind ihre Eier und Kuken auch immer dem Wetter und Fressfeinden wie Mowen und Adlern ausgesetzt. Die Inselbewohner bieten den Enten einen einmaligen Schutz: Schon seit Hunderten von Jahren bauen sie unzahlige Verschlage aus Treibholz, kleine Hauser aus Stein und Nistplatze unter ihren Wohnhausern. Dort konnen die Vogel sicher bruten. Als Gegenleistung ernten die Menschen am Ende der Brutsaison die kostbaren Eiderdaunen, mit denen die Enten ihre Nester ausgepolstert haben. Die Federn sind wegen ihrer extrem hohen Isolationskraft und der groSSen Haltbarkeit ein begehrter Rohstoff. Um eine Daunendecke zu fullen, die dann fur mehrere Tausend Euro verkauft wird, braucht es Daunen aus 60 bis 70 Nestern. Diese Lebensweise, die auch die Natur der Inseln gepragt hat, ist in Gefahr. Denn das Leben im Archipel ist einsam und hart. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten haben die meisten Bewohner die Inseln verlassen. Nur noch wenige von Ihnen kummern sich im Sommer um die Enten. Doch es gibt Hoffnung: Seit 2004 ist Vega wegen der einmaligen Symbiose von Mensch und Tier UNESCO-Welterbe - und eine neue Generation junger Norweger engagiert sich im Archipel.</desc>

<desc>(1): In Litauen: Haikus erzahlen die Deportation 1940 besetzte die Sowjetunion Litauen. Um jegliche Widerstandsversuche zu unterdrucken, verhaftete und verschleppte die Geheimpolizei 1941 zehntausende Litauer in sibirische Arbeitslager. Die "Feinde des Volkes" wurden mit ihren Frauen und Kindern abtransportiert. Die litauische Schriftstellerin Jurga Vilƒó erzahlt ihre Geschichte in der Graphic Novel Sibiro Haiku. Sie beschreibt darin den langen Weg der Angst, des Hungers und der Trennung aus der Perspektive ihres Vaters, damals ein Kind. (2): Telenovelas: Eine brasilianische Leidenschaft Jeden Abend begeistern sich in Brasilien Millionen fur ihr Lieblingsprogramm: die Telenovela. Dreiecksbeziehungen, Eifersucht, Verrat, Geheimnisse, Spannung und uberraschende Wendungen - die Serien triefen vor Klischees. Der besondere Reiz dieser Mischung aus Latino-Drama, Erfolgstraum und taglichem Leben ruhrt von den AuSSendrehs und einem gesellschaftlichen Aktualitatsbezug. (3): Im Oman: Mohammeds Kamelfleisch mit Kurkuma und Chili In der Wuste von Rimal Al Wahiba bereitet Mohammed Kamelfleisch zu, ein traditionelles und beliebtes Gericht der Beduinen. Erst wird das Fleisch mit Knoblauch und gestampftem Chili gekocht, dann kommen Pfeffer, Kurkuma und Wasser hinzu. Nach einer Stunde Schmoren auf kleiner Flamme wird das sehr gesunde Gericht mit Butterreis serviert. (4): In Texas: Ein Gericht fur den Prasidenten Sogar der Name der texanischen Stadt San Antonio erinnert an ihre mexikanische Vergangenheit.

Hier lebt die Schriftstellerin, die 1969 geboren wurde, seit 2020 auch mit ihrer Partnerin, der Philosophin Beatriz Preciado. In ihrem 2010 veroffentlichten Kriminalroman  ∫Apokalypse Baby ∫ lasst Despentes kein gutes Haar an der Heteronormativitat. Sie entfuhrt ihre Leser in die rebellische Welt der katalanischen Randgruppen, der feministischen sexpositiven Milieus, der AuSSenseiter und der extremen Gewalt. (2): Metal, Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks Finnland ist eine Hochburg des Metal. Schatzungen zufolge kommen etwa 53 Metal-Bands auf 100.000 Einwohner, insgesamt fast 3.000 im ganzen Land. Die energiegeladene Musikrichtung zehrt von den kulturellen Wurzeln des beschaulichen nordischen Landes und hat sich zum Soundtrack des finnischen Glucks entwickelt. In den 1980er-Jahren traf der im Vereinigten Konigreich entstandene Metal auf ein Finnland, das von seinen sowjetischen Nachbarn nicht nur politisch isoliert gehalten wurde. Nach dem Fall der Sowjetunion sturzten sich die Finnen regelrecht auf diese Musik, die die Erinnerung an ihre Legenden und Mythen wachhalt.

Der Koch gibt sie in einen Dampfgarer, schneidet anschlieSSend Gurken, Zwiebeln und Tomaten und besprenkelt diese mit frischer Kokosmilch.

<title>Die Muscheltaucherinnen vom Kongo-Delta</title>
<desc>Mitten im Delta des Kongo-Flusses liegt eine Insel, Kizunga Manianga. Sie ist umgeben von maandernden Flussarmen und verwunschenen Mangrovenwaldern. Hier leben und arbeiten Muscheltaucherinnen, das Tauchen ist im Fluss-Delta traditionell Frauensache. Die Taucherinnen tragen hohe Verantwortung: Ihre Familien sind auf die Ertrage angewiesen; und weil der Fischfang zuruckgeht, sind viele Manner fort, um anderswo Geld zu verdienen. Die Muscheln sind fur viele Familien die Rettung. Marie Velakutshi taucht fast jeden Tag bis zu 150 Mal im truben Wasser, bis ihre Pirogen voll sind. Die Frauen tauchen bei Ebbe, dann ist das Wasser etwa drei Meter tief; sie haben dabei nur eine Sicht von wenigen Zentimetern. Denn der Kongo ist ein tropischer Schwarzwasserfluss, eingeschwemmte Huminstoffe aus Mooren und humushaltigen Regenwaldboden farben ihn dunkel. Tuckisch ist aber vor allem die starke Stromung, eine der starksten der Welt. Wenn Marie zu lange unter Wasser bleibt, treibt sie ab und muss mit dem Fang in den Handen gegen die Stromung anschwimmen, was manchmal schier unmoglich ist. Die Taucherinnen sind deswegen stets an einer Rettungsleine festgemacht. Demnachst sollen die Muscheln, die von den Frauen nicht zur Eigenversorgung gebraucht werden, auf dem Markt in der Stadt verkauft werden, wo Marie auch ihre beiden Tochter besuchen mochte. Sie sind bei Verwandten untergebracht, damit sie dort zur Schule gehen konnen. Marie mochte vermeiden, dass die beiden eines Tages Muscheltaucherinnen werden mussen.</desc>

Jeden Tag steht er zwischen funf und halb sechs Uhr auf, er treibt wochentlich Sport und lernt sogar noch eine neue Sprache. Doch Hans-Joachim Petzke ist kein gewohnlicher Rentner: Er ist einer der sogenannten Super-Ager, deren Geheimnis am Deutschen Zentrum fur Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen in Magdeburg erforscht wird. Auf der Suche nach Menschen wie Petzke untersucht das Team um Studienleiterin Dr. Anne Maass und Beate Schumann-Werner hunderte von Probanden ab dem 60. Lebensjahr. Ob jemand wirklich ein Super-Ager ist, wird vor allem mit kognitiven Tests ermittelt. Die 86-jahrige Gisela Opitz hat sich als Studienteilnehmerin gemeldet. Sie arbeitet taglich daran, ihr Gehirn fit zu halten. Als Ehrenamtliche fuhrt sie Besuchergruppen durch den Magdeburger Dom ‚Äì und versucht, jede noch so komplexe Frage zu beantworten. Sie ist sich sicher: "Das trainiert mein Gehirn und so rostet es nicht ein". Doch ist auch sie eine Super-Agerin? Wahrend viele Menschen sich fragen, wie lange sie zukunftig arbeiten werden oder 60-Jahrige bereits vom Vorruhestand traumen, sind andere im hohen Alter sogar noch berufstatig. Doch wann ist es ratsam, altersbedingt kurzer zu treten? Walter Spielkamp aus Stuttgart ist 82 Jahre alt und Statiker.

Der chilenische Regisseur Silvio Caiozzi nutzte seinen Lieblingsort als Kulisse fur seinen bekanntesten Film, Y de Pronto el Amanecer. Dieses Meisterwerk des chilenischen Kinos zeigt die Heimkehr eines alten Mannes, der am Lebensabend auf seine Heimatinsel zuruckkehrt.

AuSSer, dass sich hier in den New Yorker Swing auch afrikanische Klange mischen. Die Gesang und Instrumente vereinende Musik ist alter als Jazz, Blues, Gospel und sogar die Gesange der Sklaven auf den nordamerikanischen Plantagen. Im Senegal besinnt sich der Jazz auf seine Wurzeln vor dem Exil, zuruck zu den Vorfahren. So klingt die Musik der Befreiung.

Durch die Begegnung mit der lokalen Bevolkerung und ihren Traditionen entdeckte er eine neue Art der Spiritualitat, die ihn pragen sollte, und die er mit dem fur ihn typischen Zynismus in Reiseberichten festhielt. (2): Guatemala: Vom Mais gesegnet Mais wird in vielen Dorfern im Osten Guatemalas bei einer Zeremonie zu Ehren des Gottes Yum Kaax als heilige Pflanze verehrt. Fur die Nachfahren der Maya steht das Getreide, das dort in vier verschiedenen Arten existiert, fur die Verbindung zwischen Leben, Himmel und Erde. Seit der Antike wird Mais in groSSem Stil angebaut - im Dschungel wie am FuSSe der Berge. Die Tradition besteht bis heute fort und macht den Reichtum des Landes aus. (3): Guatemala: Carmens Salat aus roten Bohnen In Antigua bereitet wohl niemand die Piloyada Antigue√±a besser zu als Carmen. Fur diesen sattigenden Salat benotigt sie gekochte Kidneybohnen, in kleine Wurfel geschnittene Tomaten und Zwiebeln, Knoblauch, Lorbeer sowie etwas Thymian.

<desc>Mirko Talhammer, Mitte 30, ehrgeizig und selbstuberzeugt, geht vollig in seinem Job auf: Dank windiger Praktiken ist er zum Star-Verkaufer der Firma aufgestiegen. Doch droht sein Schneeballsystem aufzufliegen. Mirko braucht schnell sehr viel Geld, wenn er nicht alles verlieren will, was er sich aufgebaut hat. Als ware das nicht genug, stehen plotzlich auch noch zwei zwielichtige Gestalten in seinem Versicherungsburo: Traumchen und Schmied, zwei Schrottis aus Mirkos Heimat. Sie sind gekommen, um den verlorenen Sohn nach Hause zu holen auf den Schrottplatz seines Vaters Fiete. Unversehens findet sich Mirko mit blutiger Nase auf dem Bock eines Lasters wieder, der ihn in die Heimat zurucktransportiert. Er erfahrt, dass sein Vater Fiete gestorben ist und ihm den Schrottplatz hinterlassen hat zusammen mit seinem jungeren Bruder Letscho, der immer noch stinksauer ist, dass Mirko die Familie im Stich gelassen hat. Dieser will so schnell wie moglich wieder weg. Doch tritt nach Fietes Beerdigung der Unternehmer Wolfgang Kercher an ihn heran, der schon lange scharf auf den Schrottplatz der Talhammers ist. Er macht Mirko ein Angebot, das der in seiner prekaren Lage nicht ablehnen kann. Nun muss er nur noch Letscho zum Verkauf uberreden, der davon nichts wissen will: "Lieber tot als Sklave!", lautet seine Devise.

<sub-title>Kawah Ijen: Inmitten der Schwefelholle</sub-title>
<desc>Indonesien gehort mit seinen 147 aktiven Vulkanen zur vulkanreichsten Region der Erde. Der besonders faszinierende Vulkan Ijen, im Osten der Insel Java, bildet den Gegensatz zum satten Grun der Walder in der Region: Karges Gestein und giftige Schwefeldampfe umgeben Arnaud, als er den Felsriesen erklimmt. Inmitten des Vulkans befindet sich der jadegrun leuchtende Kratersee Kawah Ijen, einer der saurehaltigsten Seen der Welt. Weder Tiere noch Mikroorganismen konnen in diesem sauren Milieu leben. Der Vulkan stoSSt standig Gaswolken aus, die bei Arnaud zu einem Brennen im Rachen und einem Hustenreiz fuhren. Das stort die Bergarbeiter schon langst nicht mehr: Taglich steigen die "starken Manner Javas" in den Krater, um dort Schwefel abzubauen, und das ohne Schutzkleidung. Seit 28 Jahren macht Sarno diesem Namen alle Ehre, den Arnaud bei seiner strapaziosen Arbeit inmitten der dampfenden Holle begleitet. Mit einer Art Brecheisen haut Sarno das Schwefelerz aus dem Gestein und schleppt das gelbe Gold die steilen Kraterwande hoch - pro Tag bis zu 150 Kilogramm. Die Arbeit ist nicht nur hart, sondern auch gefahrlich: Auf dem Grund des Kratersees konnen sich riesige hochgiftige Gasblasen bilden, die aufsteigen und an der Oberflache explodieren - eine todliche Falle. Auch die umliegende Bevolkerung ist von diesem "Saurefass" bedroht: Das saure Seewasser gelangt in die Flusse und stellt eine groSSe Gefahr fur die Bevolkerung, die landwirtschaftlichen Kulturen und die Boden dar. Rund 10.000 Menschen haben keinen Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser und kampfen mit gravierenden Gesundheitsproblemen. Als die Sonne untergeht, bietet sich Arnaud ein besonderer Anblick: Aus dem Krater des Ijen zungeln meterhohe blaue Flammen in die Lufte. Das spektakulare Naturschauspiel verbildlicht die Aktivitat dieses Vulkans, die fur die Menschen Einnahmequelle und Gesundheitsrisiko zugleich bedeutet.</desc>

<sub-title>Ecuador: Hoffnung fur die Nebelwalder</sub-title>
<desc>Sie gehoren zu den spektakularsten Landschaften der Erde: die Nebelwalder in den Anden Ecuadors. Hier wachsen Hunderte Baumarten, auf ihnen farbenprachtige Bromelien und Orchideen. Auch die Tierwelt ist einzigartig. Ob Vogel, groSSe Raubtiere, Frosche oder Insekten: Die Vielfalt der Formen und Farben ist uberwaltigend. Diese paradiesischen Nebelwalder sind in Gefahr. Vor allem durch die Viehwirtschaft, der immer groSSere Waldgebiete weichen mussen. Dabei wirft die harte Arbeit der Farmer kaum Gewinne ab. Doch es gibt Menschen, die das Abholzen der Nebelwalder aufhalten wollen. Einige Andengemeinden haben inzwischen ein anderes Auskommen gefunden - mit der Natur. Sie wollen die verbliebenen Nebelwalder nicht nur schutzen, sondern forsten sie wieder auf. Denn intakte Walder, schillernde Kolibris und wilde Brillenbaren locken Touristen und Wissenschaftler an. Die Besucher bescheren den Dorfbewohnern ein sicheres Einkommen, und der Wald bleibt erhalten. Der Film begleitet Barenschutzer, von der Natur faszinierte Farmer und Wissenschaftler, die um das √úberleben seltener Froscharten und der riesigen Insektenvielfalt kampfen. Alle eint dasselbe Ziel: Ecuadors Nebelwalder sollen auch auSSerhalb von Nationalparks erhalten bleiben. Das gelingt, wenn die Menschen vom Erhalt der Walder profitieren. Ein Vorbild fur andere Regionen der Welt, wo der Wald der Viehwirtschaft weichen muss.</desc>

<sub-title>Bodensee - Rettung fur die Vogelwelt</sub-title>
<desc>Der Bodensee ist eines der groSSten und schonsten Binnengewasser Mitteleuropas. Seit Jahrtausenden ist die Region fur ihre fruchtbaren Boden bekannt. Schon vor 4.000 Jahren wurden an den Ufern √Ñpfel geerntet ‚Äî heute sind die Weine aus den Spitzenlagen der Region weltberuhmt. Doch der Erfolg der industrialisierten Landwirtschaft mit ihren Monokulturen fordert seinen Tribut: Die Vogelwelt ist in den letzten 50 Jahren dramatisch geschrumpft. Rund 65 Prozent aller heimischen Vogel sind verschwunden. Der Ornithologe Prof. Peter Berthold kennt den Grund dafur. √úberall, wo groSSflachig und intensiv Landwirtschaft betrieben wird, haben Vogel und andere Wildtiere wichtige Lebensraume verloren. Es fehlen naturliche Nahrungsquellen wie Wildkrauter, Blutenpflanzen und Insekten. Im Jahr 2003 begann Peter Berthold, dem Vogelsterben aktiv entgegenzuwirken ‚Äî mit einem simplen wie genialen Plan. Ein engmaschiges Netzwerk aus neu angelegten Weihern, Hecken, Schilfgurteln und Streuobstwiesen soll Vogeln und anderen Wildtieren zuruckgeben, was sie zum Leben brauchen. Alles in direkter Nachbarschaft zu Ortschaften und den landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flachen. Der Film begleitet dieses einzigartige Projekt, in dem inzwischen zahlreiche Naturschutzer, Bauern und Gemeinden zusammenarbeiten. Er zeigt anhand aufwendiger Tierbilder und Luftaufnahmen, wie WeiSSstorche, Waldrappe und seltene Singvogel in eine Region zuruckkehren, aus der sie lange verschwunden waren.</desc>

<sub-title>WeiSS - Von Tianzhus Schneebergen in die Wuste Gobi</sub-title>
<desc>Jedes Jahr wenn die Kraniche kommen, nimmt sich der Maler Hu Zetao eine Auszeit und zieht sich in das Flussdelta des Shuangtaizi zuruck. Die schwarz-weiSSen Mandschurenkraniche gehoren zu den wichtigsten Vogeln in der chinesischen Mythologie - sie symbolisieren Bestandigkeit und ein langes Leben. "Auf einem Kranich ins Paradies des Westens fliegen, sagen wir, wenn wir das Sterben und die Unsterblichkeit meinen." erklart der Maler. In der uralten Philosophie des Wu Xing, dem Kreis der funf Elemente, gehoren die untergehende Sonne, der Westen, die Ernte und die Farbe WeiSS zusammen. Auch mit der Zeit der Trauer ist die Farbe verbunden. Ein Grund dafur, warum WeiSS fur traditionell denkende Chinesen und Chinesinnen auch nicht auf eine Hochzeit, sondern eher auf eine Beerdigung gehort. Das Element der Farbe WeiSS ist das Metall. Feng Shaoxing ist einer der renommiertesten Porzellanmeister des Landes. Er findet, dass das makellose WeiSS von Porzellan auf Menschen eine beruhigende Wirkung hat. Und: die Herstellung seines Porzellans ist untrennbar mit den funf Elementen verbunden: "Die Basis ist Porzellanerde. Sie ist voller Metalloxide. Es wird Wasser zum Formen des Rohlings und fur die Glasur genutzt. Das Feuer des Ofens brennt mit Kiefernholz. Also sind alle funf Elemente vereint: Erde, Metall, Wasser, Holz und Feuer."</desc>

<sub-title>Schwarz - Vom Feng-Shui Dorf zum Eis des schwarzen Drachenflusses</sub-title>
<desc>Wenige Lander haben so gegensatzliche Wetterextreme vorzuweisen wie China: von Wustenhitze uber tropisch-feuchte Gegenden bis hin zur subarktischen Zone. Hier, in der nordlichsten Region Chinas, liegt Mohe. Direkt am Heilongjiang, dem "Schwarzen Drachenfluss", der Grenze zu Russland. Im Norden Chinas sind die Winter lang: Bis Mai ist der Fluss meist zugefroren und der erste Schnee kommt schon Ende September. Die Himmelsrichtung Norden ist in China mit der Farbe Schwarz verbunden, auch der Winter, die Zeit der Regeneration. Die Natur kann ruhen und Kraft sammeln, bevor der Kreislauf des Lebens erneut beginnt. Veranderung und Wandel sind Grundprinzipien in der uralten Lehre der funf Elemente. Das Element der Farbe Schwarz ist das Wasser, die Grundlage allen Lebens, Symbol ruhiger Beharrlichkeit. Wasser hat in China von jeher einen groSSen Einfluss auf den Stadtebau gehabt, so auch im 900 Jahre alten Dorf Hongcun in der Provinz Anhui. Es wurde nach den Regeln des Feng Shui errichtet, im harmonischen Einklang mit der naturlichen Umgebung. Die Dacher der Hauser sind schwarz gedeckt - ein symbolischer Schutz gegen Feuer. Schwarz und WeiSS liegen eng beieinander in der chinesischen Philosophie: Die Dunkelheit umfangt den Tag. Weich und hart, oben und unten, schwer und leicht: Gegensatze bringen das Leben in Bewegung. Im Yin und Yang Zeichen ist dieser Grundgedanke symbolisiert. In der sanften Kampfkunst Tai Chi sind Ausgewogenheit und Balance von Yin und Yang die Basis aller Bewegungsablaufe.</desc>

Vor anderthalb Jahren haben sie mit ihren Pflegeeltern Jana und Hartmut und ihrer Adoptivschwester Johanna eine lange Reise angetreten, im umgebauten Schulbus quer durch Sudeuropa. In Griechenland hat die ungewohnliche Familie nun beschlossen: Hier wollen wir bleiben. "Die Kinder konnen hier den Ballast ihrer Vergangenheit abwerfen und einen Schritt machen in etwas Neues, Positives", sagt Mutter Jana. Dafur lernt die gesamte Familie intensiv Griechisch. Adoptivtochter Johanna blickt dem ersten Schultag in Griechenland mit gemischten Gefuhlen entgegen. "Vielleicht verhalte ich mich dann komisch, weil ich so nervos bin, und es fallt den anderen schwer, auf mich zuzugehen," furchtet sie. Um schonmal ein paar Madchen aus ihrer neuen Schule kennenzulernen, hat sie sich zum Volleyballtraining angemeldet. Vor dem Schulstart muss die Familie noch eine Hurde meistern: Das Jugendamt in Chemnitz will Eltern und Kinder sehen. Wird das Amt den Neuanfang der Familie akzeptieren? Die Eltern haben in Griechenland aber auch eigene Plane: Sie wollen am neuen Wohnort ein Erholungszentrum fur Pflegefamilien errichten und besichtigen dafur einen Olivenhain, der zum Verkauf steht. "Wir glauben, dass Pflegefamilien der Austausch untereinander hilft. Man fuhlt sich namlich oft ziemlich alleine", sagt Jana. Viel zu oft passiere es leider, dass Pflegefamilien aufgrund der hohen Belastung scheitern, mit schlimmen Folgen fur die Kinder.</desc>

<title>Ein tschechoslowakisches Marchen</title>
<desc>Fur Christian Paigneau war die Begegnung mit der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle wie Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Funf Jahre lang sah er sich samtliche Filme an, ohne auch nur ein Wort zu verstehen - aber die Bilder sprachen ihn an. Ihm wurde klar, dass die Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher gelernt hatten, sich mehr durch Bilder auszudrucken als durch Worte, weil sie in einem totalitaren Regime lebten. Genau darin liegt die Kraft der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle. Diese Filme finden immer einen Weg, ihre Botschaft zu ubermitteln, zum Beispiel durch ein Gefuhl oder eine bestimmte Atmosphare. Es entsteht ein intensiver Dialog mit dem Zuschauer. Milan Kundera erzahlte Paigneau von seiner Zeit als Dozent an der Film- und Fernsehfakultat der Akademie der musischen Kunste in Prag (FAMU). Die Fakultat, die zahlreiche Mitglieder der Tschechoslowakischen Neuen Welle hervorbrachte, war damals ein freigeistiger Ort und forderte die Entstehung einer Gegenkultur. Doch die Geschichte hat auch ihre Schattenseiten: Filme, die uber 20 Jahre hinweg verboten waren, Filmemacherinnen und Filmemacher im Exil, eine gespaltene Kinokultur zwischen Tschechien und der Slowakei und die Frage, warum zahlreiche Meisterwerke im Westen lange nicht gezeigt werden konnten. Der Dokumentarfilm erzahlt die Geschichte einer gescheiterten Filmbewegung. Er handelt vom geteilten Schicksal der Filmschaffenden und ihrem Verhaltnis zur Zensur. Gleichzeitig wird die Bewegung durch die Laufbahn des jungen Schriftstellers Jan Prochazka - einer der bekanntesten Personlichkeiten des Prager Fruhlings - von einer anderen Seite beleuchtet. Die einen uben mit ihren Filmen scharfe Regimekritik, der andere ist Mitglied im Zentralkomitee der Kommunistischen Partei und will das System von innen heraus verandern. Doch 1968 kommt die "Normalisierung" und mit ihr die Niederschlagung des freien Denkens ‚Ä¶</desc>

<title>Kuu imed koos Dara √ì Briainiga</title>
<desc>Dara begins his journey by revealing how the moon governs time. Returning to Ireland, near where he grew up, he goes to Newgrange ‚Äì an ancient archaeological site near the Wicklow Mountains. Its an enormous solar calendar but it is now suggested that the mysterious markings on stones around the site could make it the worlds first lunar calendars too, created by stone-age farmers to help them plan their crops. We discover how much the moon still influences life on earth. Farmer Julian Ellis plans his farming according to the phases of the moon. And we discover how much the moons immense influence on the tides also governs fisherman Sam Jones daily life. Dara next travels to the coasts of Kent to meet astrobiologist Professor Lewis Dartnell to find out just how far the moons influence on life on earth extends. Lewis explains how important the moons pull on the Earths tides has been to evolution for the animals that live in coastal areas but also on human evolution. But does the moon still affect life on earth and directly affect people, as many believe? Dara meets Dr. Rohin Francis to dig deeper into the myths surrounding the moons influence on human behavior, and to discuss some of the latest evidence. But regardless of the myths and legends ‚Äì the one way the moon undoubtably shaped our history was the race to put a human on the moon. Dara meets Dr Katie Joy who studies moon rocks brought back from the Apollo missions to find out what they discovered from them and are still discovering. Katie explains there is a new race to the moon because, incredibly, locked up in rocks across the lunar surface is believed to be vast amounts of water.</desc>

<desc>Alaska is one of the least populated states in the US where winter can last up to 9 months and temperatures can drop to below minus 62 degrees Celsius. Life Below Zero follows the lives of seven people as they face the everyday struggles of living in the middle of nowhere with limited resources, battling the elements, frozen terrain and ferocious wildlife, in a fight for survival. Surviving in this merciless land is a test of mental strength as much as it is physical, as the inhabitants must endure crippling isolation and the constant work required, where one wrong decision could cost you your life.</desc>

<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<sub-title>Aliens</sub-title>
<desc>Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system. Brian descends to the bottom of the Pacific in a submarine to witness the extraordinary life forms that survive in the cold, black waters. All life on Earth needs water so the search for aliens in the solar system has followed the search for water. Soaring above the dramatic Scablands of the United States, Brian discovers how the same landscape has been found on Mars. And it was all carved out in a geological heartbeat by a monumental flood. Armed with a gas mask, Brian enters a cave in Mexico where bacteria breathe toxic gas and leak concentrated acid. Yet relatives of these creatures could be surviving in newly discovered caves on Mars. But Brians sixth wonder isnt a planet at all. Jupiters moon Europa is a dazzling ball of ice etched with strange cracks. The patterns in the ice reveal that, far below, there is an ocean with more potentially life-giving water than all the oceans on Earth. Of all the wonders of the solar system forged by the laws of nature, there is one that stands out. In the final episode of this series, Brian reveals the greatest wonder of them all.</desc>

<desc>Documentary series. Gregg Wallace helps to unload 27 tonnes of dried haricot beans from North America and follows them on a one and a half mile journey through the largest baked bean factory in the world, which makes more than three million cans of beans every 24 hours. Gregg discovers how a laser scrutinizes every single bean, how the spice recipe for the sauce is a secret known only by two people and how the beans are not baked at all! Cherry Healey follows the journey of a discarded baked bean can through a recycling centre and on to the largest steelworks in the UK. She also takes a can that is 14 months after its best before date to a lab at the University of Coventry and is amazed when tests reveal it has the same Vitamin C levels compared to fresh tomatoes. Historian Ruth Goodman reveals how tinned food was invented to prevent British seamen developing scurvy on their long voyages at sea. Ruth also relates how Henry Heinz first marketed baked beans in the UK in the early 1900s.</desc>

<title>Planet Earth III</title>
<sub-title>Human</sub-title>
<desc>The human world, from our cities to our fields, has spread to every corner of the globe. Wildlife must now adapt to a vastly altered landscape... and contend directly with us. Some animals are meeting this challenge head-on and thriving. In Bali, long-tailed macaques have learned to steal tourists most precious items and then use them to barter with temple staff for their favourite food. The older males simply wont give you back your phone unless they get what theyre after. For many animals living alongside us, it pays to keep a low profile. Tawny frogmouths are masters of camouflage, and in Melbourne, Australia, they are preyed upon by pet cats. Nevertheless, frogmouths are doing well here because the streetlights help them find their prey, and in many parts of the city they are now found in a higher density than in the surrounding countryside. Some animals are so bold, they dont even try to hide. Rhinos walk through the streets of Sauraha, Nepal, simply to reach food on the other side of town. In Lake Tahoe, USA, black bears head right to the centre of town in search of food. Ahead of hibernation, it is crucial to put on as much weight as possible. The rich food these city bears can find in the dumpsters means that they are up to 50 per cent heavier than their country cousins. Some enterprising individuals have gone a step further. They have worked out that a simple push on a door can lead them into a room stacked high with food. Quite a surprise for someone popping into the shop to buy a snack. For wildlife, part of the challenge is to keep up with us. Pavement ants are the most common ant in New York City, outnumbering New Yorkers by 1,000 to 1. The secret to their success is their digestive system, which has been able to keep pace with the constantly changing human diet. Ninety per cent of what they eat now comes from human food. On Broadway Avenue alone, they eat the equivalent of 60,000 hotdogs a year. Life is not so straightforward for animals that are feared or persecuted by humans. Snakebites cause an estimated 60,000 human deaths every year in India alone, but in one Indian village, venomous cobras are seen hunting inside peoples houses. Remarkably, scientists believe that this co-existence has led to a change in the snakes behaviour. They move more slowly and are less likely to strike when disturbed. However, when animals come into the human world to compete for resources, it often leads to conflict. In Kenya, once the sun has set, African elephant bulls venture to fields of tomatoes to gorge. Its a dangerous job for the farmers trying to repel the largest land animals on the planet. Wildlife that eat the same food as humans doesnt always result in competition. Humpback whales off the coast of Vancouver Island inhabit waters that have been overfished. You would think that their presence would reduce fish stocks even further, but astonishingly the opposite is thought to be happening. It is all because of the iron in the whales poo! It fertilises the ocean here and feeds the phytoplankton, which is the basis of the food chain. The fish feed on the growing phytoplankton population and, even though the whales are feasting on them, their numbers are predicted to increase. Not only do the whales, and their poo, play an important role in restoring the ecosystem, but they also combat climate change. The phytoplankton photosynthesise, taking carbon out of the atmosphere, just like trees do. Thanks to whale poo, their numbers grow to such an extent that each great whale has the same impact as planting 30,000 trees! Although some species are managing to thrive in the human world, in many parts our actions are putting unprecedented pressure on wildlife. Our fates, however, are closely intertwined. If the natural world is not protected, it could be devastating for all of us. The major challenge will be reimagining the way we live on this planet to find ways to protect all life on earth.</desc>

<desc>Dara loves telescopes and is also a keen astrophotographer. In his back garden, Dara shows some of the pictures he has taken of the moon, but they all show the same side. Why is this? And what secrets does far side of the moon hold? Dara visits Jodrell Bank ‚Äì home of the UKs largest radio telescope - to tell the story of how the first photograph of the far side of the moon was taken in the 1950s and why the picture left scientists baffled, because it showed that the far side looks completely different to the side we see every evening. But there are other secrets that we are only just now starting to unlock. Scientists have been testing the rocks that the last astronauts who walked on the moon brought back, and have recently discovered that locked within them is water. Lots of it. Dara finds out how this discovery is changing lunar exploration. But everyone knows that to discover further secrets that moon might hold; we need to go back there. Dara travels to Cologne in Germany to meet Samantha Cristoforetti, a European astronaut who hopes to one day walk there. And Dara tries a virtual reality headset used to train astronauts as he takes his very own giant leap, walking on the moons surface. Back in the UK Dara visits British scientists building technology they hope will solve the moons final secrets. Dr Simeon Barber shows Dara some of the miniaturised technology being sent to the moon over the next decade to study it and Professor Mahesh Anand shows Dara how we could one day use its resources to 3D print a moonbase.</desc>

<title>Planet Earth III</title>
<sub-title>Human</sub-title>
<desc>The human world, from our cities to our fields, has spread to every corner of the globe. Wildlife must now adapt to a vastly altered landscape... and contend directly with us. Some animals are meeting this challenge head-on and thriving. In Bali, long-tailed macaques have learned to steal tourists most precious items and then use them to barter with temple staff for their favourite food. The older males simply wont give you back your phone unless they get what theyre after. For many animals living alongside us, it pays to keep a low profile. Tawny frogmouths are masters of camouflage, and in Melbourne, Australia, they are preyed upon by pet cats. Nevertheless, frogmouths are doing well here because the streetlights help them find their prey, and in many parts of the city they are now found in a higher density than in the surrounding countryside. Some animals are so bold, they dont even try to hide. Rhinos walk through the streets of Sauraha, Nepal, simply to reach food on the other side of town. In Lake Tahoe, USA, black bears head right to the centre of town in search of food. Ahead of hibernation, it is crucial to put on as much weight as possible. The rich food these city bears can find in the dumpsters means that they are up to 50 per cent heavier than their country cousins. Some enterprising individuals have gone a step further. They have worked out that a simple push on a door can lead them into a room stacked high with food. Quite a surprise for someone popping into the shop to buy a snack. For wildlife, part of the challenge is to keep up with us. Pavement ants are the most common ant in New York City, outnumbering New Yorkers by 1,000 to 1. The secret to their success is their digestive system, which has been able to keep pace with the constantly changing human diet. Ninety per cent of what they eat now comes from human food. On Broadway Avenue alone, they eat the equivalent of 60,000 hotdogs a year. Life is not so straightforward for animals that are feared or persecuted by humans. Snakebites cause an estimated 60,000 human deaths every year in India alone, but in one Indian village, venomous cobras are seen hunting inside peoples houses. Remarkably, scientists believe that this co-existence has led to a change in the snakes behaviour. They move more slowly and are less likely to strike when disturbed. However, when animals come into the human world to compete for resources, it often leads to conflict. In Kenya, once the sun has set, African elephant bulls venture to fields of tomatoes to gorge. Its a dangerous job for the farmers trying to repel the largest land animals on the planet. Wildlife that eat the same food as humans doesnt always result in competition. Humpback whales off the coast of Vancouver Island inhabit waters that have been overfished. You would think that their presence would reduce fish stocks even further, but astonishingly the opposite is thought to be happening. It is all because of the iron in the whales poo! It fertilises the ocean here and feeds the phytoplankton, which is the basis of the food chain. The fish feed on the growing phytoplankton population and, even though the whales are feasting on them, their numbers are predicted to increase. Not only do the whales, and their poo, play an important role in restoring the ecosystem, but they also combat climate change. The phytoplankton photosynthesise, taking carbon out of the atmosphere, just like trees do. Thanks to whale poo, their numbers grow to such an extent that each great whale has the same impact as planting 30,000 trees! Although some species are managing to thrive in the human world, in many parts our actions are putting unprecedented pressure on wildlife. Our fates, however, are closely intertwined. If the natural world is not protected, it could be devastating for all of us. The major challenge will be reimagining the way we live on this planet to find ways to protect all life on earth.</desc>

<desc>Dara loves telescopes and is also a keen astrophotographer. In his back garden, Dara shows some of the pictures he has taken of the moon, but they all show the same side. Why is this? And what secrets does far side of the moon hold? Dara visits Jodrell Bank ‚Äì home of the UKs largest radio telescope - to tell the story of how the first photograph of the far side of the moon was taken in the 1950s and why the picture left scientists baffled, because it showed that the far side looks completely different to the side we see every evening. But there are other secrets that we are only just now starting to unlock. Scientists have been testing the rocks that the last astronauts who walked on the moon brought back, and have recently discovered that locked within them is water. Lots of it. Dara finds out how this discovery is changing lunar exploration. But everyone knows that to discover further secrets that moon might hold; we need to go back there. Dara travels to Cologne in Germany to meet Samantha Cristoforetti, a European astronaut who hopes to one day walk there. And Dara tries a virtual reality headset used to train astronauts as he takes his very own giant leap, walking on the moons surface. Back in the UK Dara visits British scientists building technology they hope will solve the moons final secrets. Dr Simeon Barber shows Dara some of the miniaturised technology being sent to the moon over the next decade to study it and Professor Mahesh Anand shows Dara how we could one day use its resources to 3D print a moonbase.</desc>

Hell learn how to put together 1200 individual parts and attempt to braze a bike frame together using extreme heat of a thousand degrees, a skill that takes years to master. Hell also visit a leather saddle maker in Birmingham thats been making saddles for 150 years and discover how they use cowhide from UK and Ireland cows because the cold weather means they have thicker skins. Meanwhile Cherry Healey gets some tips from Cycling Team GB to help us all improve our pedal power, including how lowering your body position can make a 10% improvement to speed and efficiency. She also learns how to paint a bike frame fit for the British weather using an electro-static charge and a 180 degree hot oven; and investigates why cyclists and trucks are such a deadly combination: in London alone there have been 66 fatalities since 2011 and half of them were collisions with a truck. And historian Ruth Goodman reveals that folding bikes date back to the 1870s, and how 70,000 folding "parabikes" were manufactured during World War II, some of which played a role in the D-Day landings.

<sub-title>Fresh Water</sub-title>
<desc>Fresh water is the lifeblood of planet Earth and the stage for extraordinary animal dramas. In the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest, a little-known spectacle unfolds above a very special pond. Up to ten thousand gliding tree frogs - the worlds largest known gathering of its kind - descend from the canopy for the most important breeding event of the year. It will only last a day, and with males outnumbering females nine to one, competition is fierce. This is a party you dont want to be late for. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, as the dry season reaches its peak, the last remaining waterhole for miles around becomes a magnet for a different animal: mugger crocodiles. Giants up to five metres long lurk beneath the surface, waiting patiently for thirsty chital deer to approach the waterhole for a drink. But catching their prey is no easy feat and requires them to do something extraordinary. Documented nowhere else, these crafty crocodiles have learned how to exploit their preys need for fresh water - by creating traps. Nestled amongst flowering water lilies, newly hatched "lily-trotter" chicks learn a vital lesson - how to walk on water. Their oversized feet - almost double the length of their body - make for a wobbly start, but their dedicated father will do whatever it takes to keep them safe during the most vulnerable stage of their life. One of the biggest challenges of living in a freshwater world is its dynamic nature. It can appear, vanish or transform rapidly. Survival in these dynamic environments hinges on adaptation. In the Okavango Delta, the arrival of the great annual flood poses a significant challenge for a pack of five African wild dogs. On dry land, they are one of the continents most successful hunters, but as their hunting grounds turn to swamp, they must find an innovative way to master this water world. Meanwhile, millions of goby fish on the remote volcanic island of Bioko prepare for a perilous journey. After months feeding out at sea, they return to fresh water to breed. The safest place to lay their eggs is where ocean predators cant follow - at the very top of a 30m waterfall. Surely an impossible journey for a fish only an inch long, and one that will require a bizarre physical transformation. In a few rare places, like Lake Malawi, fresh water has remained a consistent presence for millions of years, resulting in a dazzling diversity of life. Here, over a thousand unique fish species thrive - more than any other lake on earth, but competition in these crowded waters is intense. To survive here takes ingenuity. Meet Nimbochromis livingstonii - a master of deception that tricks other fish into thinking its dead. Fresh water is vital to life, yet it is a finite resource. Of all the water on earth, only 2.5 per cent is fresh and most of that is locked up as ice or hidden deep below ground. In fact, less than one per cent of fresh water is accessible. Humans rely on fresh water for drinking, agriculture, irrigation, industry and power. Throughout history, we have devised extraordinary means to ensure it is always available for every demand, fostering the dangerous illusion that it is infinitely abundant. Yet today, two-thirds of our worlds great rivers no longer reach the sea, and in the last 50 years, freshwater species have seen an 83 per cent decline globally - a faster decline than that of species in any other habitat. One animal suffering on the front line is the Indus river dolphin in Pakistan. This species is the most endangered freshwater dolphin globally, with only around two thousand individuals remaining. Every year, these dolphins get trapped in the network of irrigation canals which form part of the vast Indus Basin irrigation system - the largest such system on earth. These canals divert water from the Indus River to irrigate crops. As water levels drop due to agricultural demands, the dolphins become stranded in ever-shrinking pools, often hundreds of kilometres away from the main river. Their only hope for survival depends on the efforts of a dedicated rescue team, working to return them back to the river before its too late.</desc>

Their oversized feet - almost double the length of their body - make for a wobbly start, but their dedicated father will do whatever it takes to keep them safe during the most vulnerable stage of their life. One of the biggest challenges of living in a freshwater world is its dynamic nature. It can appear, vanish or transform rapidly. Survival in these dynamic environments hinges on adaptation. In the Okavango Delta, the arrival of the great annual flood poses a significant challenge for a pack of five African wild dogs. On dry land, they are one of the continents most successful hunters, but as their hunting grounds turn to swamp, they must find an innovative way to master this water world. Meanwhile, millions of goby fish on the remote volcanic island of Bioko prepare for a perilous journey. After months feeding out at sea, they return to fresh water to breed. The safest place to lay their eggs is where ocean predators cant follow - at the very top of a 30m waterfall. Surely an impossible journey for a fish only an inch long, and one that will require a bizarre physical transformation. In a few rare places, like Lake Malawi, fresh water has remained a consistent presence for millions of years, resulting in a dazzling diversity of life. Here, over a thousand unique fish species thrive - more than any other lake on earth, but competition in these crowded waters is intense. To survive here takes ingenuity. Meet Nimbochromis livingstonii - a master of deception that tricks other fish into thinking its dead. Fresh water is vital to life, yet it is a finite resource. Of all the water on earth, only 2.5 per cent is fresh and most of that is locked up as ice or hidden deep below ground. In fact, less than one per cent of fresh water is accessible. Humans rely on fresh water for drinking, agriculture, irrigation, industry and power. Throughout history, we have devised extraordinary means to ensure it is always available for every demand, fostering the dangerous illusion that it is infinitely abundant. Yet today, two-thirds of our worlds great rivers no longer reach the sea, and in the last 50 years, freshwater species have seen an 83 per cent decline globally - a faster decline than that of species in any other habitat. One animal suffering on the front line is the Indus river dolphin in Pakistan. This species is the most endangered freshwater dolphin globally, with only around two thousand individuals remaining. Every year, these dolphins get trapped in the network of irrigation canals which form part of the vast Indus Basin irrigation system - the largest such system on earth. These canals divert water from the Indus River to irrigate crops. As water levels drop due to agricultural demands, the dolphins become stranded in ever-shrinking pools, often hundreds of kilometres away from the main river. Their only hope for survival depends on the efforts of a dedicated rescue team, working to return them back to the river before its too late.</desc>

<desc>Ben Fogle explores and follows the same path that various individuals have walked. Having willingly forsaken the luxuries and lifestyle that the modern world has to offer, Ben Fogle explores the less-than-ordinary life that people have swapped to in the wilderness. Many of these destinations are primarily "off the grid" in some of the most remote locations on earth, including Georgia Swamplands USA, Swedish Arctic Circle, Wilderness Island Australia and the Sahara Desert. Men, either alone or with a family, sacrifice the comforts and almost any social life to experience the hardships, challenges and rewards of a life that is constantly challenged by nature and be at one with nature. Being largely dependant on their own abilities, Ben Fogle experiences their way of living for a week to understand the reasons behind why they chose this new way of living. Released on Channel 5 in the UK, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild was produced by Motion Content Group and Renegade Pictures.</desc>

<desc>For the Easter Festival 2017 in Baden-Baden, Sir Simon Rattle and the Berliner Philharmoniker draw their inspiration from Tosca, the most well-known and most brilliant of all the Puccini operas. And that is deservedly so since Tosca is not merely a work of art, but also a gripping suspense-packed story. The opera premiered in 1900 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. The three-act opera is based on an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. For this performance, Philipp Himmelmann created a spectacular staging that offers a new view of this beloved classic. With Kristine Opolais as Tosca and Marcelo √Ålvarez as Mario Cavaradossi.</desc>

Every musical theme relates to a special colour appearing on screen. What has been so remarkable about Abbados Mahler performances is that their impact has never been achieved at the expense of the multiple sensitivities, subtleties and extreme sophistication. Together with the worlds leading youth orchestra - the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester (GMJO) - Abbado performs Mahlers Symphony No. 4 and Schonbergs Pelleas und Melisande, Op. 5. The Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester was founded in Vienna in 1986, by Abbados initiative.

The composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1887. Growing up during a time of immense social change in Brazil - with the abolishment of slavery in 1888, this was a time of social revolution and far-reaching modernizations - Villa-Lobos went on to become one of South Americas best-known composers of all time. In this third episode, Liloye Boubli explores Villa-Loboss inspiration from French classical music and Romanticism.</desc>

<desc>Celebrated German violinist Isabelle Faust performs two of J. S. Bachs incredible works for solo violin: Partita No. 2 in D minor (BWV 1004), and Sonata No. 3 in C major (BWV 1005). Both works are part of the composers well-known Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (BWV 1001-1006). Partita No. 2 is made up of four dance movements, concluded by its famous Chaconne, a monumental piece within the violin repertoire. In this Chaconne, Bach develops a series of continuous variations from a theme, exploring a complex range of harmonic possibilities. Sonata No. 3 includes an extensive fugue in which Bach employs many contrapuntal techniques. In this wonderful performance, Faust shows her mastery of Bachs technically challenging pieces. This performance was recorded at St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, Germany, in 2020.</desc>

<desc>After recording all 32 Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas to celebrate the composers 250th birth anniversary, celebrated Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz decided to record solo piano works by Robert Schumann. Schumann composed his Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor, Op. 14 (a "Concerto for piano without orchestra", in the words of music publisher Tobias Haslinger) in 1836. He dedicated it to piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles. In 1853, Schumann revised the work and added a Scherzo as a second movement. The final movement is reminiscent of Schumanns earlier composition Kreisleriana, Op. 16.

<title>Schumann - Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13</title>
<desc>After recording all 32 Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas to celebrate the composers 250th birth anniversary, celebrated Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz decided to record solo piano works by Robert Schumann. In this performance, Schwartz presents Schumanns Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13. Composed between 1834-37, the work began as a theme and a set of sixteen variations. The theme had been composed by Baron von Fricken, an amateur musician and father of Ernestine von Fricken, to whom Schumann was engaged in 1834. The work was first published in 1837, containing the theme and twelve etudes (only nine of them were indicated variations). Fifteen years later, in 1852, Schumann published a second edition of the work, eliminating two etudes and making some revisions to the piano writing.

<title>Europakonzert 2013 - Prague</title>
<desc>Every year since 1991, the Berliner Philharmoniker has given concerts in a different European city on each May 1st. These concerts have become known as Europakonzert. Every guest city has its own special cultural importance. These concerts have served two purposes: to commemorate the anniversary of the orchestras founding on May 1st, 1882, and to celebrate the common heritage of the Old World. In 1991, soon after the opening of the Eastern European countries, the first Europakonzert took place in the Czech Republic in Prague. This decision was a deliberate step and an expression of willingness to support and to bring forward the democratization and the political social changes, especially in the cultural area. In 1996 the Europakonzert took place once again in Prague (at the National Theatre). To continue this tradition the Europakonzert 2013 was celebrated at the Prague Castle at the historical Spanish Hall. Conductor: Sir Simon Rattle. Soloist: Magdalena Kozen√°.

<title>Sibelius - Symphony No. 4</title>
<desc>In 2013, the Finnish conductor Hannu Lintu was appointed principal conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Lintu studied piano and cello at the Sibelius Academy and the Turku conservatorium in Swedens southeast. He started conducting at the Sibelius Academy. His many concerts with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2012 made him the obvious replacement for Sakari Oramo, who, after many years as conductor and concert master, terminated his contract in 2012. The orchestra specializes in the performance of Finnish music, but also performs the great masterpieces of Gustav Mahler and Bela Bartok. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius is the orchestras favourite, as well as the conductor. In cooperation with Finlands national public broadcasting company Yle, all seven Sibelius symphonies are recorded and broadcast. After a brief spoken introduction about the piece, the orchestra performs the complete symphony. After Sibelius was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1908, he changed his lifestyle as well as his approach to composition. Fearing death, he quit using alcohol and tobacco. Simultaneously, the harmonies in his works grew darker and more sombre. Devils and death are among the images conjured up by the gloomy sounds of this Symphony.</desc>

<title>Bach - Brandenburg Concertos</title>
<sub-title>Bach - Brandenburg Concertos: BWV 1046-1051</sub-title>
<desc>J. S. Bachs six Brandenburg Concertos belong to his best-known works. The composer wrote these concertos between 1711 and 1720 and dedicated them in 1721 to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg. In celebration of the pieces 300th anniversary, Czech harpsichordist and conductor V√°clav Luks and the renowned Baroque ensemble Collegium 1704 recorded all six Brandenburg Concertos on historical instruments in 2021. The concertos are based on the Italian concerto grosso form, in which a group of solo instruments is set against a large ensemble. Bachs Brandenburg Concertos feature remarkable combinations of solo instruments and virtuoso solos. This performance was recorded at the Hall of Mirrors in the Kothen Castle, Germany.</desc>

<title>Monteverdi - Madrigals, Book I</title>
<desc>Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) composed nine books of madrigals in half a century, which helped transform the genre from the polyphonic, a cappella madrigals of the late Renaissance to the "concertato" madrigals of the early Baroque, shifting the styles focus to the ability of music to express emotions contained in a text. In 2011, British tenor Paul Agnew and renowned Baroque ensemble Les Arts Florissants started recording eight books of Monteverdis madrigals. In this program, Agnew leads Les Arts Florissants in the madrigals of Book I. Published on New Years day of 1587, Book I consist of seventeen madrigals for five voices. This performance was recorded at the Cite de la musique in Paris, France, in 2011.</desc>

<title>The Violins Voice</title>
<desc>How can we describe the intimate connection between an instrument and its player? World renowned violinist Frank Peter Zimmerman refers to his 1711 Stradivarius "Lady Inchiquin" as the "love of his life," but what does it take for a piece of wood to achieve such reverential status? After having to return his beloved instrument, which was owned by West LB, Zimmerman turned to Martin Schleske, a violin maker considered by many to be a "21st Century Stradivari." This documentary intertwines Zimmermans tale of separation and reunion with behind the scenes demonstrations of Schleskes work, charting the life of the violin from workshop to concert hall.</desc>

This 1992 performance, directed by Bernhard Haitink, includes the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Tolzer Knabenchor, and the Ernst Senff Choir. During the six parts of this wonderful symphony, Mahler expresses his musical vision of nature and mankinds place in it. Much like he did in his second symphony, Mahler incorporates some of his song cycle Des Knaben Wunderhorn. The fourth movement ends with a magnificent solo for alto, inspired by a poem by Friedrich Nietzsche, played here by Florence Quivar, and the fifth movement concludes with a male choir. The third symphony originally consisted of seven movements, but Mahler eventually chose to cut the seventh part, which he then used as the last movement for his fourth symphony.</desc>

<desc>Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir follows the adventures of two teens living in Paris- Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste. Marinette has a crush on Adrien, but it is not going to be a classic love story of the two. In order to protect Paris from evil Marinette turns into Ladybug and Adrien into Cat Noir. Their main enemy is Hawk Moth, who by using black butterflies infused with negative energy, wants to transform Paris citizens into super villains. It is particularly remarkable that Marinette does not know that couragious Cat Noir is her crush Adrien, which in turn does not suspect Marinette of being brave Ladybug.</desc>

<sub-title>Kurhaus Scheveningen: Beets and Rosenwinkel</sub-title>
<desc>The Dutch world-class jazz pianist Peter Beets has shared the stage with jazz greats like Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, "Toots" Thielemans, Elvin Jones, George Coleman, Johnny Griffin, Benny Golson and John Clayton. From birth, Beets was surrounded by music: he heard classical music from his mother, who is a music pedagogue, and he heard jazz from his father, who has a great fan of Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey. Although Beets parents originally did not associate the word "musician" with the word "career", music is definitely in the familys blood. At this concert at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, Peter Beets teams up with the world-famous guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. With a career spanning almost twenty-five years and including collaborating with dynamic peers like Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, as well as esteemed jazz legends like Joe Henderson, Paul Motian and Gary Burton, Rosenwinkels indelible mark in music is the consummation of being steeped in the rich and deep traditions of jazz, springing off of the shoulders of such vital underpinnings to elevate his own art to new heights, evolving the language in a way no other guitarist has since his arrival. This collaboration between Beets and Rosenwinkel guarantees brilliant music.</desc>

<title>Songs She Never Heard</title>
<desc>In 2019, the vibrant city of Sofia, Bulgaria, hosted the International A to JazZ Festival. Among the featured acts was the trailblazing jazz trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. This genre-defying artist captivated the audience with his eclectic "stretch music"; an approach that incorporates hip-hop and reaches back through the American canon into African percussion and its rich melodic content. Trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuahs quintet, which includes drummer Corey Fonville, percussionist Weedie Braimah, pianist Lawrence Fields, and bass guitarist Max Mucha, delivered a performance that defied boundaries and expectations.</desc>

After her debut at an amateur talent show in 1934, Ella joined Chick Webbs Orchestra with which she recorded several hits; after Webb died, she became the leader of the orchestra. In the late 1940s, Ella Fitzgerald became known as the First Lady of Song, with her wide vocal range of three octaves.

Coleman defined "harmolodics" as "the use of the physical and the mental of ones own logic made into an expression of sound to bring about the musical sensation of unison executed by a single person or with a group". Applied to the particulars of music, this means that harmony, melody, speed, rhythm, time and phrases all have equal position in the results that come from the placing and spacing of ideas - as evidenced in this broadcast of a performance by the Ornette Coleman Sextet.</desc>

<desc>The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra commissioned violinist Tim Kliphuis, internationally known for his genre-crossing approach to music, to write a new version of Antonio Vivaldis Four Seasons. Kliphuis choose to take improvisation as his starting point; at the same time, he intended to leave the best-known Vivaldi themes and chords in, as they give the piece its wonderful energy. The result is a fresh and exciting interpretation that never loses sight of the original. Each season has a different character: the freshness of spring is reflected by the use of Irish and Norwegian traditional music; the summer heat can be heard in the American jazz and funk rhythms; the autumn includes a galloping safari hunt in South-Africa and the ice-cold winter warms up with the energy of Russian gypsy music. For each movement, Kliphuis has a metropole in mind which he visited on his previous concert tours. Youre about to witness a truly genre-crossing spectacle!</desc>

<title>Maailma halvim inimene</title>
<desc>R: Joachim Trier. Romantiline draamakomoodia, uks 2021. aasta paremaid filme, mis tabavalt ka kaasaja heaoluuhiskonnas hiiliva kultuurilise ahistuse valja kraadib. Julie (Renate Reinsve) saab peagi 30-aastaseks, kuid pole veel elus oma kohta leidnud. Tema kallim Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie) on vanem ja tahaks Juliega lapse saada, ent naine pole selleks valmis. Julie kohtub Eivindiga (Herbert Nordrum), armub ja jatab Akseli maha. Uus suhe toob aga ka uued vastuolud. Kaks Oscari nominatsiooni. Canneis nomineeriti Kuldsele Palmioksale ja Renate Reinsve palvis parima naisnaitleja tiitli.</desc>

<title>Keelemassaja Mati Hint</title>
<desc>Annika Koppeli dokumentaalfilmis on fookuses keeleteadlase, esseisti, √µppej√µu ning Eesti taasiseseisvumise ajal poliitikas olulist rolli manginud Mati Hindi elu ja loometee. Poordelistel uheksakumnendatel oli aarmiselt oluline, et eesti keelest saaks riigikeel ja selleks tuli vastu v√µtta keeleseadus. Mati Hint oli keeleseaduse ideoloog ja tanu tema julgusele nurjusid katsed seda viimasel hetkel muuta. Nii t√µigi tema massumeelsus kasu Eesti riigile. Film uurib, missugune roll oli L√µuna-Eesti viljakatel maastikel ja karmil ajalool kompromissitu loomuse ning massaja vaimuisiksuse kujunemisel. Mati Hint suri 5. detsembril 2019. aastal, just samal paeval l√µppes ka Eesti keele aasta. Kas pole mitte tahenduslik? Filmis raagivad Mati Hindist tema kolleegid ulikoolidest, uli√µpilased, keeleteadlased ja lahedased. Tema elutoo ja isiksus avanevad uutest aspektidest. Ka Mati ise on veel kohal oma veidi toriseval, ent kindlal ja hoolival moel. Autor ja re≈æissoor Annika Koppel, produtsent Anneli Ahven. Tana on emakeelepaev.</desc>

Kuid siingi on see piir p√µhjustanud nii verd kui ka pisaraid juba mitu sajandit - kull muudab oma sangi Rio Grande, siis eraldub Texas k√µigepealt Mehhikost, et seejarel liituda USA-ga. Ja omandi parast on USA ning Mehhiko siin ikka omavahel jagelenud - seda maal, mille nad algselt v√µtsid indiaanlastelt j√µuga kaest. Piiri kosmopoliitsusest annab aga pikemalt tunnistust 84-aastane kunagine Suuria s√µjap√µgenik Maynard Haddad, kes on 60 aastat El Pasos legendaarset autopesulat ja kohvikut pidanud - kummaski neist ettev√µtmistest ei ole selle aja jooksul remonti tehtud.

<desc>Kultuuri kodu on koht k√µigile Eesti kirjanikele, muusikutele, kunstnikele, arhitektidele, disaineritele, teatri- ja filmiinimestele. See on ruumikas pesapaik, kuhu mahuvad k√µik kenasti ara ja head kultuuri pole ju kunagi liiga palju. Eesti Kultuurkapitali sajanda juubeli puhul koputame kultuuri kodu uksele ja vaatame, kes neist meie aega ja ruumi kujundavatest loojatest parajasti kodus juhtub olema. Luhiportreede sarja re≈æissoor on Erle Veber, tekste kirjutab Urmas Vadi ja loeb Marika Vaarik, arhiivis toimetab Ruth Alakula, kaamerat juhib Manuel Magi ning mikrofoni hoiab Mart Kessel-Otsa.</desc>

<title>Von Fock</title>
<desc>Kui Paul von Fock, noorim kolmest vennast, parib Sagadi m√µisa, seisab ta silmitsi raskustega oma uues rollis sotsiaalselt kohanemisel. Kuid tema erakordne v√µime majandada oma valdusi ja terav √µiglustunne kindlustavad talle kiiresti kohaliku kohtu assessori ametikoha. Oodates, et ta tegeleb vaid k√µrtsikakluste ja piirivaidlustega, ei ole ta sugugi valmis selleks, mis teda ees ootab - m√µrvamusteeriumid, v√µltsitud identiteedid, maalid ja raha, varastatud varandused ning tulevikud... 1. osa. Paul von Fock ei ole sugugi vaimustuses kui tema lapsep√µlves√µbranna Maria von Nottbeck, nuudseks kurikuulus femme fatale, astub ballil Pauli lapsep√µlvekiusaja Justus von Breverni vastu valja. Kui Justuse surnukeha leitakse jargmisel hommikul Pauli tellisetehasest, langeb kahtlus loomulikult koheselt Paulile. Kuid kohaliku kohtu assessorina on see tema kohustuseks antud kuritegu lahendada.

Sweets v√µitleb posttraumaatilise stressiga, kuid ulejaanud meeskond asub koos praktikant Daisy Wickiga ohvrit tuvastama.

Noor ja maslev FBI agent Booth poordub abi saamiseks antropoloogia teadlaste ruhma ja tanavakunstniku poole. Ta otsib asit√µendeid, millega t√µestada k√µrgetasemelise kahtlusaluse suud. Vaatamata tundmatule territooriumile asub dr. Brennan koos k√µrgharitud uli√µpilase Zacki ja Hodginsiga kohe toole, avaldades Boothile oma osavate v√µtetega muljet. Nimelt √µnnestus neil avastada uued juhtl√µngad ja t√µendada Boothi teooriat heade sidemetega ringkonnakohtuniku kohta. Samal ajal kui antud juhtum loob soodsa pinnase tulevaseks viljakaks koostooks, annab see ka aimdust lahtirulluvatest romantilistest sugemetest.

<desc>This is a documentary film about the build-up, making, release, and - crucially - music contained on this most revered of albums. With the aid of rare and classic performances, scarce interviews, seldom seen photographs and contributions from those involved in the making of the record - plus the review and critique from a panel of Zeppelin experts - this program finally lifts the lid on what many believe to be Led Zeps very finest offering. With contributions from; the albums engineer, Ron Nevison; former Yardbird, Chris Dreja; Swansong recording artist, Maggie Bell; author of The Rough Guide to Led Zeppelin, Nigel Williamson; Tight But Loose editor, Dave Lewis; Classic Rock Magazines Malcolm Dome; renowned guitar tutor and author, Rikky Rooksby and Robert Plant biographer, Neil Daniels. This is the complete story behind what what Rolling Stone called "their Tommy, Beggars Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one".</desc>

<title>Childish Gambino - Live at Rockwood Music Hall</title>
<desc>Its been a crazy year for Donald Glover, but nothing has been more blazing than his career as rapper Childish Gambino. The project, born of a Wu-Tang name generator, is full of witty, rambunctious energy, as he effortlessly demonstrates in his session at Rockwood Music Hall. Along with collaborator and musical guru Ludwig Gransson on electric guitar, Gambino rips through tracks from his wildly popular EP as well as the lead single from his debut album Camp (out now on Glassnote Records).

<sub-title>The Grateful Dead - Classic Albums: Anthem To Beauty</sub-title>
<desc>This installment of the Classic Albums series follows the making of two Grateful Dead albums, the fiercely experimental Anthem of the Sun and the understated masterwork American Beauty, which spawned melodic gems like "Sugar Magnolia" and "Ripple." Between the archival scenes and contemporary interviews with band members, the program shows a band making seismic in roads in pop music and five young guys coming to terms with artistry, mortality, and, yes, the pursuit of happiness. There is priceless footage of Neal Cassady driving Ken Keseys bus and of the Dead, surrounded by martini sipping hipsters, on Playboy After Dark. The best scenes involve band members talking about specific songs (you will never hear Phil Leshs "Box of Rain" again without thinking of it as a gift to his dying father) or deconstructing a tune by playing each track separately. Intimate and surprisingly cohesive, Anthem to Beauty is a rare glimpse into how the Deads magic was made.</desc>

<desc>A true crime show with a twist - the chiling stories are told from the fictionalised first-person pespective of the victim. The stories reveal that victims are often normal, average Americans with everyday dreams and concerns about money, their relationshiips, their jobs, their family, etc. who fall prey to the betrayal of friends, colleagues, family members or lovers. The motives vary in each epsiode, from jealousies concerning an extramarital affair to robbery, personal vendettas and secret ambitions. The show uses dramatised recreations of the events to bring the viewer closer to the people involved and also includes interviews with the victims family and the detectives who investigated the crime.</desc>

<desc>Napsitrallide valve alla jaetakse mootorratas. Aga on utlematagi selge, et kui mootorratas juba Esnas on, siis ei jata Paavel juhust kasutamata ja kohe peab sellega m√µned tiirud tegema. √ïli valab tulle ka Krista, kes Paavlit enam k√µige nooremaks meheks ei pea. Kiriku√µpetaja aga avastab poeriiulitelt enda pildiga raamatu. Vaatamata k√µigi esnalaste kahtlustele, selgub viimaks t√µsiasi, et Viktor Koosaare elulugu on veel kirja panemata. See omakorda vallandab Esnas elulooraamatute kirjutamise laine. Varik aga otsustab teha l√µpu igasugusele ebakainele s√µidulaadile, mis Esna vanad ja noored vallutanud on. K√µige parem on selleks muidugi korraldada koolitus.</desc>

<title>Kas loome kaed?</title>
<desc>T√µeline telemangude klassika, kus mangus osalejal ei ole vaja malumangu teadmisi v√µi fuusilisi oskuseid. Mang kaib raha ja auhindade peale. On vaja vaid natukene √µnne, et teha √µige otsus! Kas valida saatejuhi poolt pakutav rahasumma v√µi salaparane kingitus? Kas jaada oma otsusele kindlaks v√µi proovida oma √µnne veelgi suurema v√µidu nimel?

<title>Glenn Gould - Hereafter</title>
<desc>HEREAFTER is a retrospective of the life and work of Gould, seen from todays point of view. Based a synthesis of all the documents existing on Gould, whether of a musical or of a literary and intellectual nature, this film strives to deal with the question of Goulds genius such as it is perceived by his audience, an audience that extends far beyond the strict notion of a musical audience. It is made with the participation of anonymous "disciples", making it seem as if Gould himself was answering their questions; meanwhile, Gould appears as the master of the narration of the film.

She lives among humans and understands that animals are free, rather than slaves to the human race. A fantastic and entertaining bestiary appears on stage. The childrens performance is superb. Who else could convey such freshness, such savagery and such an imaginary world? We are offered a glimpse of an enchanted and fantastical world where love and freedom reign supreme. This light-spirited, na√Øve and melancholy fable introduces us to the great theatre of life. With ineffable poetry, Jan√°cek listens to and recreates the eternal Song of the Earth. .</desc>

<sub-title>Say OK</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Under the Big Top</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<sub-title>Jeremy and Alex</sub-title>
<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia. Tutti elementi che ritroveremo nelloriginalissimo studio di "√à sempre mezzogiorno!", ispirato al mondo delle fiabe e immerso simbolicamente nel bosco della Val Borbera. Ad affiancare la Clerici nella conduzione, un cast fisso che √® la metafora della saggezza popolare: due nonnine e una zia pronte al commento, alla sferzata e a sporcarsi le mani tra i fornelli, limprobabile factotum Alfio insieme al Maestro Panificatore Fulvio Marino. Unallegra compagnia di giro che accompagner√† gli spettatori verso il pranzo, cucinando gomito a gomito con loro, incuriosendo con piccoli tutorial e aneddoti, tastando il polso ad unItalia che si ritrova sempre pi√π bisognosa di leggerezza e gentilezza. Latmosfera √® casalinga ed accogliente: si ride, si commentano i fatti del giorno, si fa del sano gossip, si impara qualcosa, si interagisce con il pubblico da casa e intanto si cucina. Ogni giorno ad aiutare Antonella in cucina ci saranno due cuochi, uno avvezzo alla tv e uno esordiente. Oltre alla cucina e allattualit√†, laltra colonna del programma sono i giochi telefonici con cui gli spettatori possono vincere, di volta in volta, un premio in denaro o un prodotto. Un implicito omaggio alla tv degli anni 80 rivisitato in chiave contemporanea. Durante la settimana ci saranno degli appuntamenti fissi: la fatina dei dolci, il maestro pasticcere pronto a dispensare consigli e tecniche raffinate, lesperto di territorio e di vino, e Angela Frenda, che con la sua rubrica "Ricette damore" racconter√† storie e aneddoti di personaggi famosi. Il tutto mentre sui fuochi bolle il sugo, qualcuno offre una fetta di salame o un caff√®. Proprio come a casa.</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia. Tutti elementi che ritroveremo nelloriginalissimo studio di "√à sempre mezzogiorno!", ispirato al mondo delle fiabe e immerso simbolicamente nel bosco della Val Borbera. Ad affiancare la Clerici nella conduzione, un cast fisso che √® la metafora della saggezza popolare: due nonnine e una zia pronte al commento, alla sferzata e a sporcarsi le mani tra i fornelli, limprobabile factotum Alfio insieme al Maestro Panificatore Fulvio Marino. Unallegra compagnia di giro che accompagner√† gli spettatori verso il pranzo, cucinando gomito a gomito con loro, incuriosendo con piccoli tutorial e aneddoti, tastando il polso ad unItalia che si ritrova sempre pi√π bisognosa di leggerezza e gentilezza. Latmosfera √® casalinga ed accogliente: si ride, si commentano i fatti del giorno, si fa del sano gossip, si impara qualcosa, si interagisce con il pubblico da casa e intanto si cucina. Ogni giorno ad aiutare Antonella in cucina ci saranno due cuochi, uno avvezzo alla tv e uno esordiente. Oltre alla cucina e allattualit√†, laltra colonna del programma sono i giochi telefonici con cui gli spettatori possono vincere, di volta in volta, un premio in denaro o un prodotto. Un implicito omaggio alla tv degli anni 80 rivisitato in chiave contemporanea. Durante la settimana ci saranno degli appuntamenti fissi: la fatina dei dolci, il maestro pasticcere pronto a dispensare consigli e tecniche raffinate, lesperto di territorio e di vino, e Angela Frenda, che con la sua rubrica "Ricette damore" racconter√† storie e aneddoti di personaggi famosi. Il tutto mentre sui fuochi bolle il sugo, qualcuno offre una fetta di salame o un caff√®. Proprio come a casa.</desc>

Es gibt zwar einen Hauptverdachtigen, aber mit der Technik der damaligen Zeit kann dem Mann die Tat nicht zweifelsfrei nachweisen. Mehrere Male in den kommenden Jahren fallt der Mann durch ahnliche Delikte auf, aber nie kann er endgultig verurteilt werden. Ein Beamter jedoch verfolgt den Fall hartnackig. Kann der Verdachtige mit modernen Ermittlungsmethoden schlieSSlich doch uberfuhrt werden? Die dunkle Seite Hollywoods - In einem Canyon nahe Los Angeles wird eine beinahe schon mumifizierte Leiche gefunden. Trotz enormer Gewalteinwirkung auf den Schadel konnen die Forensiker die Identitat des Mannes ermitteln - Roy Radin, ein Broadway Produzent aus New York. Schnell finden die Ermittler heraus, dass Radin mit seiner Geschaftspartnerin Lanie Jacobs in Streit geraten war. Doch Jacobs ist bereits aus Los Angeles verschwunden. Einige Monate spater verhaftet die Polizei einen der Bodyguards Jacobs und kann den Mann in Zusammenhang mit dem Mord bringen. Doch konnen die Beamten beweisen, dass Lanie Jacobs die Tat geplant und beauftragt hat? Morderische Gier - Lakeland, Florida. In einem Wagen wird die Leiche eines Mannes gefunden. Das Auto hat eine Zulassung aus Georgia, uber 400 Kilometer entfernt von Lakeland. Rasch ermitteln die Beamten die Identitat des Mannes, aber was trieb in ihn hierher und wer konnte sein Morder sein? Die Beamten stehen vor einem Ratsel und bitten FBI-Profilerin Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Rasch wird klar, dass es sich bei den Tatern um Profis gehandelt haben muss. Aber aus welchem Grund wurde Robert Brooks getotet? Die Beamten und Hinman hecken einen gewagten Plan aus, um die Morder zu uberfuhren...</desc>

<sub-title>Todliche Gewasser / Blutige FuSSspuren</sub-title>
<desc>Todliche Gewasser - Drei grausame Morde an Frauen erschuttern Palm Beach. Ein Serienmorder treibt sein Unwesen und konnte bisher nicht gestoppt werden. Da wird eine vierte Leiche entdeckt und die Befurchtung steht im Raum, dass der Killer erneut zugeschlagen hat. Die ermittelnden Beamten bitten Dayle Hinman um Hilfe. Die erfahrene Profilerin soll klaren, ob Rene Baker ebenfalls dem Serientater zum Opfer fiel. Dale ist sich rasch sicher, dass es sich um einen anderen Tater handeln muss. Die einzige Spur, die dieser am Tatort hinterlassen hat ist ein Zigarettenstummel. Kann der Morder damit uberfuhrt werden? Blutige FuSSspuren - Sabatino Russo und seine Frau Eugenia betreiben ein kleines italienisches Restaurant in Hollywood. Insbesondere die lokalen Polizisten gehoren zu ihren Stammkunden. Umso schockierter sind die Beamten, als sie zur Szenerie eines grausamen Doppelmordes gerufen werden und die beiden Wirtsleute als Opfer vorfinden. Der Tatort gibt Ratsel auf - die Leichen liegen in verschiedenen Zimmern, ein Besenstiel und ein Wischmopp liegen auffallig herum. Beide Opfer wurden geschlagen, aber die Todesursache sind heftige Schnitt- und Stichwunden. Bei der Obduktion finden die Gerichtsmediziner einen Teil eines Messers im Kopf eines der Opfer.

Selbst auf dem Dachboden wird regelmaSSig gesaugt und Staub gewischt. So stehen mittlerweile das Haus samt Speicher und den beiden angrenzenden Scheunen voll mit Bjorns Schatzen. Der Ursprung von Bjorns Sammelleidenschaft ist jedoch tragisch: Der 42-Jahrige ist psychisch krank. Er leidet an Angst- und Panikattacken. Dadurch kann er seinem Beruf als Altenpfleger nicht mehr nachgehen. Das Sammeln wurde zum Ventil seiner Krankheit und zur groSSen Leidenschaft. Seit kurzem hat Bjorn ein neues Projekt: ein altes Haus, das er billig gekauft hat. Fur Renovierungsarbeiten fehlt jedoch das Geld. Jetzt mochte er sich schweren Herzens von seinen heiSS geliebten Schatzen trennen. Bjorns Eltern Ingrid (62) und Manfred (62) glauben nicht, dass sich ihr Sohn einfach so von seinen Sammlerstucken trennen wird. Deswegen soll RTL II-Trodelprofi Mauro Corradino helfen, die richtigen Abnehmer fur Bjorns Sachen zu finden. Denn dann, so hoffen alle, fallt Bjorn der Abschied leichter...</desc>

<desc>Die drei Berliner Dragqueens Gloria Viagra (Alter gibt sie nicht an), Sheila Wolf (43) und Dana Regyonal (36) aus Berlin Kreuzberg fuhren ein schrilles Leben. Ton angebend bei dem Trio ist Gloria. Die Diva mit dem GardemaSS von 2,18 Meter ist Frontfrau ihrer eigenen Rockband und schlagt sich die Nachte als DJane um die Ohren. Immer an ihrer Seite ist Sheila, die sich dem Burlesque-Tanz verschrieben hat. Dana ist mit 36 Jahren die Jungste. Die gelernte Kosmetikerin hat ein Auge auf das √ÑuSSere, denn eins ist klar: Nur tiptop gestylt wagen sich die Damen auf die StraSSe. Das bedeutet sexy Kleidchen und kiloweise Make-up, schlieSSlich ist Sexappeal keine Frage des Alters. Im gemeinsamen Kreativappartement tufteln die drei an Ideen, schlurfen Sekt und lassen es sich gut gehen. Die Hande machen sie sich nicht schmutzig, dafur gibt es schlieSSlich eine Putzfrau. Elke (49) geht in der Pflege des Haushaltes auf. In ihrer Wohnung blitzt und blinkt es uberall. Ansonsten gabe es allerdings auch √Ñrger mit Ehemann Frank (49). Der Kraftfahrer ist nicht nur ein Sparfuchs, sondern auch extrem penibel. Die Spulmaschine muss korrekt eingeraumt sein, es muss alles an seinem Platz stehen, selbst fur das Aufhangen der Wasche gibt es eine Ordnung. Und wenn die nicht eingehalten wird, rappelt es im Karton. Die Tochter Saskia (18) und Monique (14) stecken in der Pubertat und streiten fur ihr Leben gern. Gepaart mit Franks Geiz bedeutet das fur Elke, dass sie immer zuruckstecken muss. Der Traum von einer Mitgliedschaft im Fitnessstudio wird fur die Backereifachverkauferin wohl ewig ein Traum bleiben.

<desc>Sabine bedeuten ihre drei Tochter alles. Auch wenn es mit Madels im Alter von elf bis 16 Jahren auch mal Zank und Zoff gibt, lasst Sabine sich nicht aus der Ruhe bringen. Die 35-Jahrige will ihren Tochtern nicht nur Mutter, sondern auch Freundin sein. Die Erziehung muss Sabine aber alleine meistern, denn von ihrem Mann hat sie sich schon lange getrennt und ein neuer Ersatzpapi wird derzeit nicht gesucht. Da Sabine nicht arbeiten will, solange ihre Kinder noch zuhause sind, ist das Geld knapp. Aber das Quartett ist sparsam.

Carmen (46) und ihr neun Jahre jungerer Mann Ralf haben sich ihren groSSen Traum erfullt und ein schickes Eigenheim gebaut. Das Geld dazu verdienen beide, Ralf mit Softwareentwicklung, Carmen mit Telefonsex.

<desc>Umwelt und Naturschutz sind eine wichtige Aufgabe von Bund und Landern. SchlieSSlich geht es dabei um den Schutz von Natur und Mensch. Eine tolle Sache sollte man meinen. Warum landen jedoch solche Umwelt- und Naturprojekte immer wieder in unserer Sendung? Weil sie leider allzu oft nach dem Prinzip "gut gemeint, schlecht gemacht" umgesetzt werden. Und so versickern die Steuergelder in nicht funktionierenden Fischtreppen oder werden fur sinnlose Aussichtsplattformen, verballert. Doch damit wird weder der Natur noch dem Menschen geholfen. Schade eigentlich. Um die Politik auf die Missstande aufmerksam zu machen, haben wir fur unsere neue Best-Of-Sendung die tierisch verrucktesten Falle von Steuergeldverschwendung bei Umwelt- und Naturprojekten ausgewahlt, bei denen selbst Grumpy-Cat sich vor Lachen schuttelt.</desc>

Das stern TV Spezial "Leben im Brennpunkt - Das Experiment" beantwortet all diese Fragen: hautnah und spannend.

<title>Jag ar monstret _ filmen om Freddie Wadling</title>
<desc>F√• svenska artister har lamnat ett s√• oforglomligt avtryck som Freddie Wadling (1951-2016) - och f√• ar lika mytomspunna. Med en rost som strackte sig fr√•n de djupaste brunnarna till de himmelska hojderna, benamndes han ofta som "Sveriges basta rockrost". Filmen utforskar Wadlings morka livsode och fascinerande karriar - fr√•n hans tid med band som Cortex, Blue for Two och Flaskkvartetten, till hans solokarriar som omfattade allt fr√•n elektronisk musik till finstamda visor. Trots sin kultstatus kampade Wadling med scenskrack och ett liv praglat av alkohol och droger. En revanschhistoria om en utstott kille som fick ett oerhort anseende och skrev in sig i den svenska musikhistorien. Svensk dokumentar fr√•n 2025 av Lars Hogeus och Robert Lagerstrom.</desc>

Recent sightings may prove that a Native American legend about a mysterious race of giants is true. The series also explores The Missing Douglas and whether an interdimensional portal in the Alaska Triangle led to the disappearance of the airplane carrying 44 military personnel in 1950.</desc>

Vanamehe kahtlused tulevad aga hooga tagasi, kui rahahadas Greg asub teisele tookohale uhes ravimikompaniis. Suur katsumus laheneb Pami ja Gregi kaksikute sunnipaeva peo kujul, kuhu tuleb kohale kogu klann, sealhulgas Pami endine lavaler Kevin (Owen Wilson). See on Gregi jaoks v√µimalus t√µestada l√µplikult skeptilisele Jackile, et ta on oma majas perekonnapeaks. Ent k√µikv√µimalikud eksitused, luuramine ja salamissioonid muudavad Gregi ulesande vaga raskeks. Kas temast saab perekonna jargmine patriarh, "Risti-Focker"‚Ä¶ v√µi katkeb usaldusring igaveseks? "Vaikesed Fockerid" on kolmas osa ulimenukast komoodiasarjast, mis algas aastal 2000.

<title>Jean-Claude Barny, le cinema du N√®g maron</title>
<desc>Jean Claude Barny est un coureur de fond qui, du fait de ses origines, continue de se battre plus quun autre pour pouvoir realiser des films independants sur lhistoire du peuple Antillais. Il a la particularite detre √† linitiative de films qui ne ressemblent √† aucun autre, car il defend plus que jamais une triple appartenance, tra√ßant un pont entre Argenteuil (l√† o√π il a grandi), la Guadeloupe (son pays natal) et, plus recemment, la C√¥te dIvoire (o√π il se sent legitime de transmettre son experience dauteur et de cineaste).Notre demarche filmique est de mettre en images ce qui fait la specificite de son travail de cineaste. La trame narrative de ce documentaire sera une construction triangulaire. Nous retracerons le ,parcours de Jean-Claude Barny √† la fois sur 3 lieux geographiques (Argenteuil, la Guadeloupe, et Abidjan), mais aussi √† travers ses 3 passions (la musique, la litterature, et le cinema).</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

Face √† lillettrisme dans les prisons, des benevoles devoues initient les detenus √† la lecture, pour leur reinsertion. Ce documentaire autour de la lecture en prison est lexploration dune relation entre des benevoles et des personnes incarcerees. Chaque semaine, ces benevoles se rendent aupr√®s des detenus pour les accompagner de fa√ßon individuelle dans une evasion mentale : la lecture. Gr√¢ce au livre et √† la litterature, le lien se cree, la parole se lib√®re, un horizon souvre √† la fois en termes de connaissances, de niveau, mais aussi de representation du monde. A travers les visites des benevoles, nous entrons dans un univers marque par les cliches et les fantasmes, o√π la litterature sert de fil conducteur, de mediation, doutil autoreflexif et bien souvent, de therapie. En off, les textes des fiches de lecture des personnes detenues racontent leurs doutes, leurs desillusions, leurs espoirs.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<title>Sans frapper</title>
<desc>Ada avait 19 ans quand elle a subi une agression sexuelle, mais elle na depose plainte que dix ans plus tard. De son temoignage interprete par quatorze hommes et femmes, √† la premi√®re comme √† la troisi√®me personne, emerge le vecu empathique dun traumatisme qui tisse la possibilite dun "nous". Qestions taboues Peut-on se mettre √† la place dune victime de violence sexuelle ? La realisatrice Alexe Poukine traite du recit du viol, douloureux passage oblige pour les personnes agressees et objet de toutes les interpretations sous le poids des stereotypes, des prejuges et du patriarcat... Dans la bouche des differents interpr√®tes, lhistoire dAda ‚àí √† laquelle dautres aussi effroyablement banales font echo ‚àí devient universelle, mais se charge aussi de doute et de suspicion, pla√ßant le telespectateur dans linconfortable et derangeante position de juge, et lobligeant √† explorer ses propres a priori. Car, au fil du film, des questions intimes restees taboues affleurent : ai-je le droit de metre sentie depossedee de mon corps au cours dune telle experience ? Puis-je en parler ? Que signifie le consentement pour moi ? Entrela√ßant voix et visages, mots et maux, dans un montage delicat, Sans frapper repond au jeu devastateur de labus de pouvoir par un autre jeu, benefique et porteur despoir : celui dune communaute qui sexprime.</desc>

Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<title>Armasta, ara unusta</title>
<desc>37-aastane Marina elab nagu tavaline tanapaeva lahutatud naine: kasvatab uksi 12-aastast tutart ja tootab kunstikoolis √µpetajana. Marinale naib, et tema elu on juba elatud ja midagi uut enam tulemas pole. Kuid k√µik muutub, kui naine tutvub juhuslikult Nikitaga. Noormees armub temasse esimesest pilgust ja teeb k√µik, et olla oma armastatu k√µrval. Kuid paraku on ta k√µigest 20-aastane. Vanusevahe Nikitat ei hairi, ta on valmis Marinaga abielluma. Kuid Marina kardab ja on kindel, et tema tutvuskond ei liida seda heaks. Naine on kahevahel ja p√µgeneb l√µpuks oma meeletu armastuse eest lapsep√µlvelinna. Marina vanemad viivad ta kokku oma uue naabri Igoriga. Igor on kindlameelne, vastutustundlik, Marinasse armunud ja mis p√µhiline, temaga uhevanune. Marina on n√µus saama Igori naiseks. Kuid kas Nikita loobub oma armastatud naisest?</desc>

<title>Armasta, ara unusta</title>
<desc>37-aastane Marina elab nagu tavaline tanapaeva lahutatud naine: kasvatab uksi 12-aastast tutart ja tootab kunstikoolis √µpetajana. Marinale naib, et tema elu on juba elatud ja midagi uut enam tulemas pole. Kuid k√µik muutub, kui naine tutvub juhuslikult Nikitaga. Noormees armub temasse esimesest pilgust ja teeb k√µik, et olla oma armastatu k√µrval. Kuid paraku on ta k√µigest 20-aastane. Vanusevahe Nikitat ei hairi, ta on valmis Marinaga abielluma. Kuid Marina kardab ja on kindel, et tema tutvuskond ei liida seda heaks. Naine on kahevahel ja p√µgeneb l√µpuks oma meeletu armastuse eest lapsep√µlvelinna. Marina vanemad viivad ta kokku oma uue naabri Igoriga. Igor on kindlameelne, vastutustundlik, Marinasse armunud ja mis p√µhiline, temaga uhevanune. Marina on n√µus saama Igori naiseks. Kuid kas Nikita loobub oma armastatud naisest?</desc>

<title>Kangelane</title>
<desc>Iraani draama, mis v√µitis Cannesi filmifestivalil Grand Prix. Rahim on sumpaatse olekuga meesterahvas, kes satub vangi, sest ei suuda v√µlga tagasi maksta. Ta saab vanglast paariks paevaks valja ja puuab selle ajaga laenuandjaga asjad ara klaarida. √úks asi viib teiseni ja peagi on Rahimist saanud sotsiaalmeedia abil kangelane. See ei tee aga ei tema olukorda ega enesetunnet kuidagi paremaks‚Ä¶ Asghar Farhadi ("Lahkuminek") kirjutatud ja lavastatud film raagib filosoofilise ning teravmeelse m√µistuloo kangelaseks olemise suhtelisusest.</desc>

<title>Kangelane</title>
<desc>Iraani draama, mis v√µitis Cannesi filmifestivalil Grand Prix. Rahim on sumpaatse olekuga meesterahvas, kes satub vangi, sest ei suuda v√µlga tagasi maksta. Ta saab vanglast paariks paevaks valja ja puuab selle ajaga laenuandjaga asjad ara klaarida. √úks asi viib teiseni ja peagi on Rahimist saanud sotsiaalmeedia abil kangelane. See ei tee aga ei tema olukorda ega enesetunnet kuidagi paremaks‚Ä¶ Asghar Farhadi ("Lahkuminek") kirjutatud ja lavastatud film raagib filosoofilise ning teravmeelse m√µistuloo kangelaseks olemise suhtelisusest.</desc>

Kahe elult luua saanud inimese vahel tekib kull tugev side, kuid kas sellest piisab, et ebainimlikult rankadele katsumustele vastu pidada?</desc>

<title>Die Elon-Musk-Story</title>
<sub-title>Die Elon-Musk-Story: Superreich und supermachtig?</sub-title>
<desc>Elon Musk ist der reichste Mensch der Welt - und polarisiert wie kaum jemand sonst. Viele furchten ihn als manischen Narzissten mit Hass auf alles, was woke, queer oder allzu demokratisch ist. Von seinen Anhangern wird Elon Musk vergottert als Konig der Nerds, als Erfinder, der die Welt verandert. Musk verschiebt die Grenzen des technisch Machbaren, aber auch des Sagbaren. Wahrend sein Unternehmen SpaceX die erste wiederverwendbare Rakete baut, hetzt Musk auf seinem Social-Media-Kanal X gegen Migranten, trommelt fur die AfD und andere Parteien am rechten Rand in Europa. Dabei attackiert er gerne auch demokratisch gewahlte Regierungen. Wie radikal denkt dieser Exzentriker wirklich? Was hat ihn gepragt? Und wie gefahrlich ist er fur die demokratische westliche Welt? Eine Spurensuche fuhrt die Autoren Carolin Heise und Tristan Sohngen in sein Geburtsland Sudafrika, ins Silicon Valley und nach Boca Chica in Texas. Interviews mit seinem Vater Errol Musk zeigen, in welchem harten Umfeld Musk junior aufwuchs. Schon fruh muss er sich gegen jugendliche Schlager behaupten. Und, laut eigener Aussage, auch gegen seinen Vater, der ihn und seinen Bruder Kimbal mit verbaler und korperlicher Gewalt erzog. Vater Errol bestreitet das im Gesprach und erzahlt seine eigene Version der Geschichte. Im Silicon Valley entwickelt sich Musk zum waghalsigen Unternehmer, der immer alles auf eine Karte setzt. Risiko-Kapitalgeber Carsten Maschmeyer oder der Ex-VW-Chef Herbert Diess erklaren, wie Musk seine Firmen mit nahezu manischer Intensitat zum Erfolg treibt - und so das Fundament legt fur seinen heutigen Einfluss auf die Welt. Musk kann nicht nur die Massen beeinflussen und hat finanziell nahezu unerschopfliche Ressourcen. Sondern er beherrscht mit dem Satelliten-Netzwerk Starlink auch modernste Tech-Infrastruktur und verfugt seit der US-Wahl auch uber politische Macht. Als enger Trump-Vertrauter soll Musk US-Regierungsausgaben uberwachen und kurzen. Der ehemalige Verteidigungsminister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg oder der Sicherheitsexperte Frank Sauer ordnen Musks Machtfulle ein, die mittlerweile historisches AusmaSS erreicht hat. Mit analytischem Blick schaut die Dokumentation zudem auf Musks digitales Abbild: sein X-Account. Dort postet Musk unablassig, an manchen Tagen bis zu 15 mal in der Stunde. Er interagiert mit rechtsextremen Accounts, teilt Verschworungstheorien - und mischt sich in die deutsche Bundespolitik ein, indem er Staatsoberhaupt und Kanzler beleidigt, die AfD lobt. Sein Biograf erzahlt, wie Musk nahezu suchtig ist nach der hyperpolarisierenden digitalen Welt seines eigenen sozialen Netzwerks. Fur viele Beobachter wie die Publizistin Marina Weisband agiert Musk auf der Plattform diktatorisch - und radikalisiert sich in immer schnellerem AusmaSS.

<desc>Millionenbetrug mit Testzentren Das Corona-Desaster Coronatests sollten wahrend der Pandemie helfen, das Infektionsgeschehen unter Kontrolle zu halten. √úberall im ganzen Land entstanden in Windeseile Testzentren. √úberprufungen, ob Abrechnungsdaten stimmten, gab es anfangs kaum. Diese Situation nutzten auch Kriminelle und Betruger, in wenigen Wochen wurde manch einer zum Millionar. Den Schaden durch Abrechnungsbetrug schatzen Experten auf 1,7 Milliarden Euro. Callcenter-Abzocke Perfide Jagd auf deutsche Anleger Die neueste Abzockfalle, in die Zehntausende deutsche Kleinanleger tappen, heiSSt Cybertrading. Sie gilt aktuell als die bedeutendste Form von Internetbetrug - mit Schaden in Milliardenhohe. "frontal" ist mit einem internationalen Rechercheteam den Abzockern auf der Spur - sie reicht von Nordrhein-Westfalen bis ins georgische Tiflis. Neue Schulden mit alten Mehrheiten Wie CDU und SPD die Grunen umgarnen Im Wahlkampf hatten sich Friedrich Merz und die Union fur Haushaltsdisziplin und Schuldenbremse ausgesprochen. Nach der Wahl soll diese nun aufgeweicht werden und ein 500 Milliarden Euro schweres Sondervermogen fur Investitionen kommen. Fur das Vorhaben brauchen die schwarz-roten Koalitionsverhandler allerdings die Grunen, doch die zieren sich.</desc>

<sub-title>Wer starkt unsere Demokratie?</sub-title>
<desc>Demokratie muss nicht alt, steif und verstaubt sein. Egal ob Jungpolitiker, Influencerin oder Kulturverein - sie alle geben der Demokratie einen neuen Look. Demokratie gestalten und erlebbarer machen, das gelingt mit Events auf dem Land, Videos im Netz und Festivals in der Stadt. Fur "plan b" geht Reporterin Antonia Lilly Schanze auf die Suche nach Menschen, die mit ihren Ideen unser demokratisches System starken. "Ich weiSS nicht, wie es vielen geht, aber ich hatte keinen guten Politikunterricht", so Sally Lisa Starken. Deswegen ging die Content Kreatorin aus Bielefeld selber auf die Antwortsuche. Nun will sie mit ihrer Vision "politikwach" machen. Dabei setzt sie sich fur politische Aufklarung ein. Und das macht die 33-Jahrige mit uber 90.000 Instagram-Followern schon ziemlich gut: Auf Instagram, TikTok und im Podcast erklart sie einfach und verstandlich politische Hintergrunde und ordnet aktuelle News ein. Mit ihrem politischen Kinderbuch erklart sie den Jungsten die Grundprinzipien der Demokratie und auf verschiedenen Buhnen spricht sie daruber, wie wir unsere Demokratie erhalten und starken konnen. In Zwickau, einer Stadt, die vom demografischen Wandel betroffen und rechte Ideologie langst in der Mitte der Gesellschaft angekommen ist, leistet der gemeinnutzige Verein "Alter Gasometer" eine demokratische Mammutaufgabe. Mittendrin Matthias Bley. Der 37-Jahrige sieht sich als Netzwerker und Motivator, der junge Menschen, die Zivilgesellschaft und Vereine darin bestarkt, die Stadt Zwickau zu einem lebens- und liebenswerten Ort zu machen. Mit niedrigschwelligen Angeboten wie Musikveranstaltungen, Poetryslams und Festivals mochte der Verein demokratische Werte und die Jugendbeteiligung starken. Letzteres gelingt ihm auch durch einen Jugendbeirat, der den Zwickauer Stadtrat berat. Demokratie passiert nicht nur irgendwo in den Parlamenten, sondern beginnt direkt vor Ort in den Kommunen. Das weiSS auch der 24-jahrige Jungpolitiker Luca Piwodda. Seine Vision: Den landlichen Raum attraktiv gestalten und junge Menschen fur Politik begeistern. Und fur diese Vision setzt er sich mit vollem Engagement ein. Schon wahrend seines Studiums grundet Luca eine eigene Partei und spater auch einen Kulturverein. Durch sein politisches Engagement fallt er auf und wird einer der ersten geforderten Talente der Organisation JoinPolitics. Dieses Jahr kandidiert Luca sogar fur den Kreistag Uckermark und als Burgermeister fur seine Heimatstadt Gartz (Oder). Warum er kandidiert, konnte man pure Heimatliebe nennen: "Hier wohne ich, hier will ich mich einfach wohlfuhlen. Dazu gehort es auch, dass es vorangeht und nicht alles auf der Stelle tritt." Beide Teile "plan b: Da geht was, Deutschland!" sind ab 20. August 2024 in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar.</desc>

Was will Ex-Soldat und Wohnungsinhaber Kaminski mit diesem Nervenkrieg bezwecken? Warum hat er die beiden Beamten in diese grausame Falle gelockt? Bald wird klar, Kaminski verlangt endlich die Gerechtigkeit, die ihm als Kriegsversehrtem eigentlich zusteht. Melanie und Mattes geraten an die Grenzen ihrer seelischen Belastbarkeit.

Dass nur Kaminski selbst die Bombe entscharfen kann, lasst ihre Situation noch auswegloser erscheinen. Kaminski will erzwingen, das Gutachten eines Psychologen uber ihn zu andern, da es fur ihn und seine Familie verheerende Folgen hatte. Melanie beweist in diesem brisanten Fall um einen Kriegsveteranen ihre uneingeschrankte Kompetenz als Polizistin, und auch Mattes ist bereit, fur seine Kollegin alles zu riskieren.</desc>

<title>Zehn Tage allein mit Papa</title>
<desc>Isabelle, Antoine und ihre Kinder bekommen unerwartet einen Luxusskiurlaub geschenkt. Doch als Isabelle aus beruflichen Grunden daheimbleibt, artet der Trip unter Papas Aufsicht vollends aus. Antoine verbannt die Kinder zwar schnell in den Skiunterricht, jedoch bringen ein verhasster Ex-Kollege sowie das Liebesinteresse einer Fremden den auf Skiern talentfreien Vater anderweitig ins Wanken. - Fortsetzung der Erfolgskomodie "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" Familie Mercier hat sich fortschrittlich organisiert: Wahrend Isabelle (Aure Atika) vor kurzem eine Anwaltskanzlei gegrundet hat, kummert sich Antoine (Franck Dubosc) als Hausmann um die Kinder Arthur (Swan Joulin), Chloe (Violette Guillon), Maxime (Ilan Debrabant) und Jojo (Evan Paturel). Auf Einladung von Steevy (Bertrand Uzeel), dem neuen Ehemann von Isabelles Schwester Audrey (Helena Noguerra), erhalt die Familie die Chance zu einem Luxusskiurlaub in Courchevel. Doch als bei Isabelle am Abreisetag ihr lang ersehnter erster Gerichtsfall eingeht, bleibt die Mutter kurzfristig zu Hause. Hilflos macht sich Antoine alleine mit den Kindern auf, die das Luxuskettenhotel aus der Familie ihres neuen Schwagers schnell auf den Kopf zu stellen wissen. Zwar kann Antoine seinen Nachwuchs tagsuber in der angeschlossenen Skischule abgeben, doch neben seinen eigenen, ungelenken Fahrversuchen muss sich der Familienvater plotzlich mit einem alten Bekannten herumschlagen. Sein groSSspuriger Ex-Arbeitskollege Thierry Di Caprio (Alexis Michalik) will vor Ort mit Immobiliengeschaften einen neuen Sektor fur seinen Arbeitgeber erschlieSSen. Antoine entwickelt den Wunsch, selbst wieder Geld zu verdienen. Daruber hinaus hat die alleinstehende Laure (Annelise Hesme) ein Auge auf Antoine geworfen, was auch der Nachzuglerin Isabelle nicht vorenthalten bleibt. Nach "Zehn Tage ohne Mama" landete der franzosische Regisseur Ludovic Bernard in seiner Heimat auch mit der Fortsetzung "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" einen Kinoerfolg, wenngleich er dieses Mal nicht die Millionenmarke bei den Zuschauern knacken konnte. Gedreht wurde die Familienkomodie in dem bekannten Skigebiet Courchevel. Im Presseheft des Films beschreibt Bernard den Dreh als beinahe Urlaubserfahrung. So wurde auch in Drehpausen fleiSSig Ski gefahren oder die eine oder andere Schneeballschlacht ausgefochten. Stilistisch macht sich "Zehn Tage allein mit Papa" sein im Vergleich zu seinem Vorgangerfilm gewandeltes Setting ebenfalls zunutze, denn der Film kommt noch slapstickhafter daher und schopft dabei das (korperliche) Potenzial seines Wintersportambiente voll aus.

<sub-title>Wer sorgt fur unsere Sicherheit? Das Comeback des Bunkers</sub-title>
<desc>Theoretisch gibt es in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Schutzraume fur 480.000 Menschen. Das entspricht etwa 0,56 % der Bevolkerung. Praktisch lautet die Zahl der Platze jedoch: Null. Denn im Zweifel ist keine der 579 Bunkeranlagen einsatzbereit. Es gibt kein Wasser oder keinen Strom, die Bunker werden vermietet, wurden verkauft oder sind seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gewartet. Deutschland steht in Sachen Zivilschutz blank da. Nach 1990 wurden alle Atomschutzanlagen auSSer Dienst gestellt, die ubrigen Bunkeranlagen zu Geld gemacht, eingemottet oder zu Wohnungen oder Kultureinrichtungen umgewidmet. Als ware mit der deutschen Wiedervereinigung eine √Ñra des ewigen Friedens angebrochen. Das Bundesamt fur Bevolkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe verweist auf U-Bahnhofe oder Keller, in die sich die Bevolkerung bei Bedarf fluchten soll. SchlieSSlich sei die Qualitat des Bauens in Deutschland auSSergewohnlich hoch. Nicht alle wollen sich mit solchen Beschwichtigungen zufriedenzugeben. Seit Beginn des Kriegs in der Ukraine boomt der private Bunkerbau. "√úber 70 Prozent unserer Kundschaft sind Frauen", sagt Mario Piejde von der Berliner Firma BSSD. Vor dem Hintergrund der gestiegenen Kriegsgefahr und taglich wachsender Zweifel an der Einsatzbereitschaft der Bundeswehr und NATO widmet sich "aspekte" dem Comeback des Bunkers. 80 Jahre nach Ende des 2. Weltkriegs steigt "aspekte" in alte Bunker, besichtigt neue Bunker und wundert sich uber nicht vorhandene Bunker. Jo Schuck erkundet mit dem Verein "Berliner Unterwelten" die Spuren des Luftkriegs unter dem Pflaster der Hauptstadt und spricht mit dem Militarhistoriker Sonke Neitzel uber die aktuelle Kriegsgefahr. Architekt Andreas Knapp fuhrt durch den zum Kulturort umgebauten Bilker Bunker in Dusseldorf, ein ehemaliger NVA-Kommandant gibt Einblicke in die groSSte Bunkeranlage Deutschlands. Den Stollenkomplex bei Halberstadt, den KZ-Haftlinge einst in den Berg getrieben haben, wollte ein sachsischer Immobilienunternehmer zu luxuriosen Schutzraumen umbauen. Weil die Anlage unter Denkmalschutz steht, muss er seine Plane nun deutlich abspecken. DJ Paula Schopf steht regelmaSSig auf der Buhne des Deutschen Theaters Berlin ("Mein Herz dein Bunker - 290 BPM") und kann sich noch gut erinnern, wie die junge Techno-Szene Anfang der 90er-Jahre in Bunkern ihren Freiraum fand. Anselm Kiefer, der vor 80 Jahren in einem Luftschutzkeller geboren wurde, und Regisseur Joshua Oppenheimer ("The End"), der ein Bunker-Musical mit Tilda Swinton ins Kino bringt, fragt "aspekte" nach der Sinnhaftigkeit der neuen Bunkerwelle: Was nutzt der schonste Bunker, wenn vor den Bunkerturen die Welt untergeht?</desc>

Nach 40 Jahren sozialistischer Diktatur bricht plotzlich die staatliche Kontrolle weg. Viele DDR-Burger fuhlen sich befreit, viele aber auch verunsichert und allein gelassen.

<sub-title>√Ñgypten - Natur schreibt Geschichte</sub-title>
<desc>Welche Krafte haben das alte √Ñgypten gepragt. Was waren die Grunde fur Aufstieg, Wohlstand und den dramatischen Niedergang des Pharaonenreichs? Naturgewalten spielten eine entscheidende Rolle. Hannah Emde reist zu gigantischen Tierskeletten in der Wuste, steigt nachts in uralte Grabkammern, versucht eine Kobra zu fangen und hilft mit bei einer Ausgrabung auf einer Insel im Nil. Der Nil: Lebensader und Schicksalsfluss Hannah Emde, Tierarztin, Artenschutzerin und Moderatorin von "Faszination Erde", macht sich in √Ñgypten auf eine spannende Reise. Sie beginnt auf dem Nil, der Lebensader √Ñgyptens - heute wie damals. Wie sicherte dieser machtige Fluss im alten √Ñgypten den Wohlstand des Landes? Die regelmaSSig auftretenden Fluten des Nils waren die Grundbedingung fur eine florierende Landwirtschaft. Doch die Natur ist launisch. Erst durch Innovationen gelang es, den Fluss zu zahmen. Nilometer, ausgeklugelte Bewasserungssysteme und ein tiefer Respekt vor der Natur halfen den √Ñgyptern, ihre Felder optimal zu bewirtschaften. Klimawandel in der Antike Hannah Emde erfahrt von gewaltigen Klimaveranderungen, die die Region im Laufe der Jahrtausende geformt haben: Das Kippen der Erdachse lieSS einst die Sahara in eine grune Savanne erbluhen, die erst spater zur Wuste wurde. So trieb die Natur die Menschen in neue Lebensraume - immer auf der Suche nach Wasser und fruchtbaren Boden. Das Niltal war wie ein Magnet fur die Menschen. Es war der fruhe Beginn der Entwicklung zur agyptischen Hochkultur. Naturkatastrophen und der Untergang der Pharaonen In den eisigen Tiefen Gronlands entdecken Forschende Beweise fur ein Naturereignis, das √Ñgyptens Schicksal besiegelte: Ein gewaltiger Vulkanausbruch auf den Aleuten-Inseln vor Alaska im Jahr 43 v. Chr. sorgte fur globale Klimaveranderungen. Die Fluten des Nils blieben aus, Durren und Hungersnote trieben viele Menschen in den Tod - ein Schicksalsschlag, den das Reich der Pharaonen nicht uberlebte. Die Kraft der Natur - gestern und heute Hannah Emde zeigt, dass die Geschichte √Ñgyptens nicht allein von Menschen geschrieben wurde. Es waren die Krafte der Natur - Wasser, Wind, Sand, Vulkane und das Klima - die den Lauf der Dinge immer wieder veranderten. Die Frage drangt sich auf: Welche Rolle wird die Natur in unserer eigenen Zukunft spielen? Drei Folgen "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Die beiden ersten Folgen steht bereits ab dem 5. Marz 2025 vorab in der ZDFmediathek zur Verfugung.</desc>

<title>Wunderwelt Chemie</title>
<sub-title>Die Bausteine der Natur</sub-title>
<desc>Woraus besteht die Welt? Diese Frage fasziniert Menschen seit jeher. Dr. Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim nimmt die Zuschauer mit auf eine Reise durch die Geschichte der Wissenschaft. In der Antike ging man von vier Elementen aus: Feuer, Wasser, Erde und Luft. Nach Jahrhunderten der Forschung sind heute 118 Elemente bekannt - und die Suche geht weiter. Entdeckt wurden sie von visionaren Mannern und Frauen, die Wissenschaftsgeschichte schrieben. Dass Festes flussig und Flussiges zu Gas werden konnte, inspirierte die fruhen Alchemisten, eine solche Verwandlungskunst selbst anzuwenden. Meist auf der Suche nach dem "Stein der Weisen", der unedle Metalle in Gold umwandeln sollte. Auch wenn alle Versuche ins Leere liefen, erbrachte doch mancher Irrweg wichtige Erkenntnisse. So der von Hennig Brand, der im Jahr 1669 versuchte, den Stein der Weisen aus Urin zu gewinnen, und dabei den Phosphor entdeckte. Viele Elemente wurden erst nach einer Kette von Irrtumern gefunden. Wie die Entdeckung des Sauerstoffs durch den Franzosen Antoine de Lavoisier, der damit die abenteuerliche Theorie des "Phlogistons" widerlegte, eines ominosen Stoffes, von dem man angenommen hatte, er entweiche bei Verbrennungen. 118 Elemente fuhrt das Periodensystem heute auf. Es ist nicht weniger als die Ordnung der Welt, die in Spalten und Gruppen nach der Kernladung und den chemischen Eigenschaften der Elemente aufgegliedert ist. Dieses Grundverstandnis verdankt die Wissenschaft dem Russen Dimitri Mendelejew, dem das Periodensystem der Legende nach im Traum erschien. Seine Leistung besteht nicht nur aus der Ordnung der bekannten Elemente, die er erstmals 1869 der √ñffentlichkeit prasentierte, sondern auch in der Definition der Leerstellen im Periodensystem. Er prophezeite, dass es dort noch Elemente geben musse, auch wenn man sie zu seiner Zeit noch nicht kannte. Mendelejew sollte recht behalten. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts begann erstmals eine Frau, die Lucken des Periodensystems zu fullen: Marie Curie. Sie entdeckte die Elemente Radium und Polonium. Bis zuletzt war sie vom Nutzen der radioaktiven Strahlung uberzeugt, die von ihnen ausging - etwa fur die Behandlung von Tumoren. Den Abwurf der erste Atombombe hat Curie nicht mehr erlebt. In dieser Folge der Reihe erklart Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim die Grundlagen einer faszinierenden Wissenschaft, der viele Menschen skeptisch gegenuberstehen. "Fur viele ist Chemie nur ein verhasstes Schulfach, das man nicht schnell genug abwahlen konnte, dabei erklart sie uns diese verruckte faszinierende Welt, in der wir leben", sagt die Wissenschaftsjournalistin. Drei Folgen "Terra X: Wunderwelt Chemie - Mit Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim" werden sonntags um 19.30 Uhr ausgestrahlt. Alle Filme der Reihe sind bereits ab Montag, 4. Oktober, in der ZDFmediathek unter terra-X.zdf.de zu finden. Die erste Folge, "Die Bausteine der Natur", wird am Sonntag, 10.

<title>A Breath Away</title>
<desc>Nach einem Erdbeben wird Paris von einem giftigen Nebel heimgesucht, der die Bevolkerung zur Flucht in die Hohe zwingt. Auch Anna, Mathieu und ihre Tochter Sarah kampfen ums √úberleben. Durch eine seltene Immunkrankheit ist Sarah an eine immobile Sauerstoffkammer gebunden. Zur Sicherung ihrer lebensnotwendigen Isolation sind Mathieu und Anna zu allem bereit, wahrend Paris im Nebel und im Chaos versinkt. Sarah (Fantine Harduin), die Tochter der Wissenschaftler Anna (Olga Kurylenko) und Mathieu (Romain Duris), leidet an einer seltenen Immunerkrankung und ist dadurch gezwungen, in einer isolierten Sauerstoffkammer zu leben. Wahrend Mathieu regelmaSSig die Welt auf der Suche nach neuen Therapiemethoden fur Sarah bereist, priorisiert Anna die begrenzte Zeit mit ihrer Tochter. Unangekundigt wird Paris von einem schweren Erdbeben erschuttert, das einen giftigen Nebel freisetzt, der die Metropole zunachst nur bis zu einer bestimmten Hohe verschlingt. Mathieu und Anna finden in ihrem Wohnhaus Zuflucht bei dem alten Ehepaar Lucien (Michel Robin) und Colette (Anna Gaylor) im Dachgeschoss, wahrend Sarah in ihrer vor dem Nebel geschutzten Kammer ausharren muss. Sarahs Eltern sind bald dazu gezwungen, sich fur Besorgungen und die Inganghaltung von Sarahs Isolationskabine nach drauSSen zu wagen. Ob des Ausnahmezustands regiert in den StraSSen von Paris das Chaos. Als der Nebel plotzlich erneut zu steigen beginnt, mussen Mathieu und Anna unvermittelt eine Evakuierung von sich und Sarah vorbereiten. Das emotionale Katastrophendrama "A Breath Away" des kanadischen Regisseurs Daniel Roby konzentriert sich in erster Linie auf die menschlichen Aspekte seines dargestellten Unglucksszenarios. Dadurch grenzt sich die franzosisch-kanadische Produktion ein Stuck weit von den amerikanischen Blockbustern des Genres ab, die ihren Fokus oft auf die groSStmogliche Imposanz ihrer Endzeitbilder legen. Dennoch wurde die Herstellung der Katastrophensituation in "A Breath Away" alles andere als stiefmutterlich angegangen. So wurden beispielsweise fur den im Film omniprasenten Nebel verschiedene Farbtone hinsichtlich ihrer psychologischen Wirkung getestet, um einen moglichst toxischen und bedrohlichen Effekt sicherzustellen.</desc>
