<desc>A current affairs documentary series from Al Jazeera, examining powerful presidents, prime ministers, governments, religious institutions, and businesses, investigating how they use, or abuse, their powerful positions. The series has been running since 2007, sending investigative journalists across the world to capture stories at their source, many of which are divisive, criminal, or discordant. Stories have included a high-profile, Italian euthanasia case, which instigated fiery debates across the predominantly Catholic country, a disturbing tale of child sex tourism in Madagascar, and the aftermath of the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan.</desc>

<title>Ist da jemand - so wie ich?</title>
<desc>"Ist da jemand - so wie ich?" - das ist die Frage, die sich Ella Glendining seit ihrer Kindheit stellt. Sie kommt in einem Dorf in Ost-England zur Welt, als Kind von nicht-behinderten Eltern: ohne Huftgelenke und mit verkurzten Oberschenkel-Knochen. Trotz einer glucklichen, fast "magischen" Kindheit erlebt sie auch schmerzhafte Ausgrenzung. Sie wird Filmemacherin und macht sich als junge Erwachsene auf die Suche nach anderen Menschen, die so aussehen wie sie. Im Laufe ihrer langen Reise wird sie ungeplant schwanger und Mutter eines gesunden Jungen. Zusammen mit ihrer kleinen Familie macht sie sich auf den Weg in die USA, wo sie endlich Menschen trifft, die so aussehen wie sie und ahnliche Erfahrungen machen. Ella Glendinings schonungslos offener, humorvoller und allen Widrigkeiten zum Trotz optimistischer Film ist das filmische Tagebuch einer Reise zu sich selbst. Er zeigt alltagliche Diskriminierungen, die Menschen mit Behinderungen in einer Welt voller Nicht-Behinderter ausgesetzt sind. Gleichzeitig ist der Film voller Momente der Hoffnung und Solidaritat und ruckt jene Menschen in den Fokus, die wegen ihrer vermeintlichen "Andersartigkeit" um Sichtbarkeit und Respekt kampfen. Schatzungsweise 650 Millionen Menschen leben weltweit mit einer Behinderung. Laut der 2001 beschlossenen UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention hat jeder Mensch das Recht auf gesellschaftliche Teilhabe. Die Teilhabe von behinderten Menschen ist also kein Akt der Fursorge oder Gnade einer mehrheitlich nicht behinderten Gesellschaft. Dennoch sind sie bis heute nicht ausreichend vor Diskriminierung und Ausgrenzung geschutzt.</desc>

<title>Fanny Ardant - Die Geburt einer Leidenschaft</title>
<desc>Fanny Ardant ist eine Weltklasseschauspielerin, die in keine Schublade passt. Ihre ersten beiden Filme drehte sie mit dem legendaren Nouvelle-Vague-Regisseur Fran√ßois Truffaut. William Karel war bei den Dreharbeiten als Fotograf vor Ort und konnte miterleben, wie sich der Regisseur und die Schauspielerin ineinander verliebten. 1984 verstarb Truffaut dann unerwartet mit nur 52 Jahren. Fanny Ardant sagte spater: "Ich geriet in eine Art Wachtraum. Die Begegnung mit Fran√ßois hat das Feuer in mir entfacht. Dieser Moment war der Hohepunkt meines Lebens." Dieses Feuer ermoglichte der lebenshungrigen jungen Frau, sich selbst zu finden und fur die Filmwelt zu offnen. In bislang unveroffentlichten Archivaufnahmen macht William Karel die leidenschaftliche Initialzundung erfahrbar, die Fanny Ardant zu der Schauspielerin machte, die sie heute ist.</desc>

<desc>Ein Ruckblick auf zwei wichtige Ereignisse der Woche: Keine Ruckkehr zum Rentenalter von 62 Jahren: Hat sich Fran√ßois Bayrou selbst zensiert? Der franzosische Premierminister Fran√ßois Bayrou hat einer Ruckkehr zum gesetzlichen Rentenalter von 62 Jahren am 16. Marz offentlich abgelehnt. Mit dieser √ÑuSSerung gefahrdete er jedoch die vor drei Wochen aufgenommenen Gesprache der Sozialpartner uber die Rentenreform von 2023, die ohne Tabuthemen gefuhrt werden sollten. "Das Rentenalter von 62 Jahren ist eine zentrale Frage. Mit dieser Aussage bricht der Premierminister nicht nur sein Wort, sondern verrat auch Millionen von Arbeitnehmern, die sich sechs Monate lang fur die Aufhebung der Rentenreform eingesetzt haben", reagierte die Generalsekretarin der Gewerkschaft CGT, Sophie Binet, und kundigte ihren Ruckzug vom Verhandlungstisch an. Fran√ßois Bayrou hatte den Sozialisten die Neuverhandlung der Bedingungen der Rentenreform versprochen, um die Zensur seiner Regierung im vergangenen Januar zu vermeiden. Kann die Erklarung des Premierministers ihn nun sein Amt kosten? Israel-Hamas: Wer wollte das Ende der Waffenruhe in Gaza? Knapp zwei Monate nach Inkrafttreten der Waffenruhe zwischen der israelischen Armee und der Hamas hat die israelische Armee am 18. Marz erneut massive Angriffe auf den Gazastreifen durchgefuhrt. Nach Angaben des palastinensischen Zivilschutzes liegt die aktuelle Zahl der Todesopfer bei 504, darunter 190 Minderjahrige. Die ursprungliche Waffenstillstandsvereinbarung sah eine Phase 2 vor, die einen dauerhaften Waffenstillstand und einen Ruckzug der israelischen Armee aus dem Gazastreifen gegen die Freilassung aller verbleibenden Geiseln beinhaltete. Der israelische Premierminister Benjamin Netanjahu rechtfertigt die Wiederaufnahme der Angriffe mit der "wiederholten Weigerung" der Hamas, die 58 noch in Gaza festgehaltenen Geiseln freizulassen, von denen die israelische Armee annimmt, dass 34 nicht mehr am Leben sind. Netanjahu "halt den militarischen Druck" fur unverzichtbar, um die Freilassung der Geiseln zu erreichen. In Israel hat diese Haltung eine Welle von Demonstrationen und den Zorn der Familien der noch in Gefangenschaft befindlichen Geiseln ausgelost. Der Journalist Jean-Paul Vespini veroffentlicht im Arthaud-Verlag "Zola √† bicyclette, libre et dans le vent". Darin erzahlt er von der allgemeinen Begeisterung fur das "Velociped", das den Autor √âmile Zola und seine Zeitgenossen der intellektuellen Elite von Guy de Maupassant uber Colette bis hin zum Prinzen von Sagan oder Maurice Leblanc Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts erfasste. Das Fahrrad hatte mehrere Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft, wie die Entwicklung der Industrie oder die Starkung der Freiheiten fur Frauen, die nun auch Hosen tragen durften. Die franzosische Regierung mochte die Prufung eines Gesetzes, das bereits im Februar vom Senat verabschiedet wurde und das Tragen eines Kopftuchs bei Sportwettkampfen verbieten soll, auf die Tagesordnung der Nationalversammlung setzen. Innenminister Bruno Retailleau befurwortet diesen Vorschlag und erklarte, Sportplatze durften keine Orte religioser oder politischer Einflussnahme sein. Die Sportministerin Marie Barsacq warnte jedoch davor, das Tragen des Kopftuchs mit religioser Radikalisierung gleichzusetzen. Im Duell der Woche lasst Valerie Brochard die beiden Politiker gegeneinander antreten. Auf einem Kongress der Aktivisten seiner Partei Place publique forderte der Europaabgeordnete Rapha√´l Glucksmann die Vereinigten Staaten auf, Frankreich die Freiheitsstatue zuruckzugeben. Seiner Meinung nach verdient das Land die Werte des Denkmals heute nicht mehr. Die Sprecherin des WeiSSen Hauses, Karoline Leavitt, reagierte auf einer Pressekonferenz, indem sie daran erinnerte, dass "die Franzosen es den Vereinigten Staaten zu verdanken haben, dass sie heute nicht Deutsch sprechen mussen. " Paola Puerari berichtet. Der Comic-Zeichner Jul war emport, als er von der Stornierung des Drucks von 900.000 Exemplaren seines Comics mit dem Marchen "Die Schone und das Biest" durch das franzosische Bildungsministerium erfuhr. Das ursprunglich fur alle Funftklassler vorgesehene Album sei nach Angaben der Generaldirektorin fur Schulbildung, Caroline Pascal, letztendlich "nicht fur den erwarteten padagogischen Ansatz" fur Schuler im Alter von 10 bis 11 Jahren geeignet. Davon erzahlt Claude Askolovitch in seiner Geschichte der Woche. Und schlieSSlich zeigen wir Ihnen die internationale Schlagzeile uber das Telefonat zwischen Donald Trump und Wladimir Putin, die von unseren Gasten ausgewahlten Fotos der Woche und den humorvollen Beitrag "Kontinentaldrift" von Beno√Æt Forgeard.</desc>

<desc>Seit einigen Jahren tragt Clement Urion die Burde, das offizielle Pfluck-Datum fur die Arnikaernte freizugeben. Der Krautersammler, der mit seinem sechskopfigen Team auf seinem Bauernhof La Ferme du Bien-etre aus Krautern und Heilpflanzen atherische √ñle, Blutenwasser und Krautertees herstellt, ist einer der wenigen, die die Pflanze offiziell ernten durfen. Tausende Wildpflanzen wachsen heute noch in den Vogesen, doch nur 148 Arten durfen von den Krautersammlern gepfluckt und weiterverarbeitet werden. Jedes Jahr im Juni gehort seine ganze Aufmerksamkeit der Arnika montana ‚Äì jener wilden Heilpflanze, die auf den Wiesen des circa 1.200 hohen Markstein wachst. Nur Clement darf bestimmen, wann die zwei Tage dauernde Ernte beginnt ‚Äì je nach Blutenstand und Wetter. Den GroSSteil der Ernte bekommt das bekannte Natur-Kosmetikunternehmen Weleda, dessen Chef Denis Graeffly erklart, warum die Arnika so wichtig ist: "Sie ist eine fuhrende Pflanze. Das heiSSt, sie ist Teil vieler Weleda-Produkte. Sie ist auch auf therapeutischer Ebene wichtig, sie hat viele Wirkungen auf dieser Ebene. Und auch fur Kosmetika, besonders fur eine externe Anwendung, hauptsachlich in der Form von √ñl". Krautersammler zu sein, ist nicht nur eine Kunst, sondern auch ein Beruf. Doch jede Menge Hurden und Gesetzgebungen machen Leuten wie Clement Urion das Leben schwer.</desc>

In den wilden Weiten der Camargue und den engen Gasschen der alten Dorfer scheinen AuSSerirdische gelandet zu sein! Seit den 60er Jahren stehen fliegende Untertassen aus Glas und ockerfarbenem Stein in der Landschaft und warten darauf, wiederentdeckt zu werden. Die kompromisslos futuristischen Bauten stammen von einem Autodidakten und Humanisten, der aus seiner Zeit gefallen schien: dem franzosischen Kunstler und Architekten Armand Pellier. (2): Antigua: Insel der singenden Fasser Antigua gilt als eine Geburtsstatte der Steel Pan. Seit vielen Jahrzehnten lebt die Antilleninsel im Rhythmus dieser metallischen Schlaginstrumente, mit denen sich zunachst die schwarze Arbeiterjugend ihre Wut uber die soziale Ungerechtigkeit von der Seele trommelte. Die ersten "Stahlpfannen" entstanden aus ausrangierten √ñlfassern. Heute sind die Drums ein allseits beliebtes und international anerkanntes Musikinstrument.

Noch ahnte niemand, dass sie eines Tages die ganze Welt erobern sollten. Mit der Veroffentlichung des allerersten Pokemon-Videospiels begann der unaufhaltsame Siegeszug der Anime-Figuren, die in Japan als Pocket Monsters bekannt sind und sich auch 30 Jahre nach ihrer Entstehung ungebrochener Beliebtheit erfreuen. Ob Videospiele, Sammelkarten, Spielfilme oder Zeichentrickabenteuer: Die von Satoshi Tajiri erdachten Geschopfe halten eines der weltweit profitabelsten Franchise-Unternehmen am Laufen. (2): Sudwest-Frankreich: Vom Rugby erwahlt Rugby ist in Okzitanien viel mehr als nur ein Sport. Von GroSSbritannien aus eroberte die handfeste Mannschaftssportart gegen Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts rasch den Sudwesten Frankreichs. In Toulouse und den umliegenden Dorfern stand Rugby fur tief verwurzelte republikanische Vorstellungen und behauptete sich auch gegen Anfeindungen der katholischen Kirche, die darin eine "fleischliche Sunde" sah. Der Sport steht auch im Einklang mit der Arbeit auf dem Land und begeistert viele Landwirte. Heutzutage gibt es in Toulouse kaum jemanden, der sich dem Rugby-Fieber entziehen kann - ein wirksames Mittel fur die soziale Integration.

In der modernen Molkerei von Sohn Mustafa entstehen hochwertige, biologische Buffelmilchprodukte, die weit uber die Region hinaus geschatzt werden. Mit ihrer Arbeit tragt die Familie dazu bei, die Tradition der Buffelhaltung lebendig zu halten und gleichzeitig innovative Wege in der Produktion zu gehen. In Arakli, einem kleinen Kustendorf, bewahrt Huseyin die Kunst des Holzbootbaus. Seit Jahrhunderten wird hier Kastanienholz zu robusten Kuttern verarbeitet, die der rauen See trotzen.

<sub-title>Die fruchtbare Mitte</sub-title>
<desc>In der fruchtbaren Mitte der turkischen Schwarzmeerkuste liegen die Provinzen Giresun, Ordu, Trabzon und Samsun an den Nordhangen des Pontischen Gebirges. Diese Region ist ein Schmelztiegel aus kultureller Tradition, naturlicher Vielfalt und nachhaltiger Lebensweise. Hier leben die Menschen im Einklang mit der Natur: Fischerei, Tabak- und Haselnussernte pragen das Leben und den Rhythmus der Bewohner. Das Kizilirmak-Delta an der Kuste ist ein Naturschutzgebiet, in dem Wildtiere ungestort leben und Zugvogel auf ihrer Reise von Europa und Asien nach Afrika einen Rastplatz finden. In diesem Zufluchtsort dokumentiert Prof. Dr. Sancar Baris zusammen mit einer Gruppe von Studierenden Lebensweisen und Zugrouten der Wasservogel. Der langste Fluss der Turkei, der Kizilirmak bewassert die Felder rund um die Stadt Bafra und bietet den Nahrboden fur den Tabak, aus dem die starken, geschmacksintensiven Samsun-Zigaretten gerollt werden. Yilmaz ist einer der vielen Haselnussbauern in Gorele, Giresun, wo sie die Haselnusse auch liebevoll die "fettigen, pummeligen aus Giresun" nennen. Sowohl bei der Haselnussernte als auch beim Pflucken der Tabakblatter packt das ganze Dorf mit an. In der Hafenstadt Arakli lernen wir Emine kennen. Sie ist die einzige Fischerin an der turkischen Schwarzmeerkuste. Wie das Meer sie und ihren Mann wieder zusammengefuhrt hat, steht symbolisch fur die tiefe Verbindung zwischen Mensch und Meer. Die Geschichten der Menschen und die Vielfalt der Natur machen diese Region zu einer Schatzkammer des turkischen Nordens.</desc>

<sub-title>Der wilde Osten</sub-title>
<desc>Der Osten der turkischen Schwarzmeerkuste ist ein Landstrich, der die Krafte der Natur und die Traditionen seiner Bewohner vereint. An malerischen Hangen, steilen Felswanden und entlang tosender Wasserfalle erleben wir die besondere Beziehung zwischen Menschen und Tieren. Zwischen den 4000 Meter hohen Kackar-Bergen und dem vertraumten Kustenstadtchen Arhavi lernen wir den Imker Bulent und seine Frau Nazli kennen. Zwischen steilen Wasserfallen und dichten Laubwaldern produzieren 80 Millionen Bienen kostbaren Honig, der dank der unberuhrten Natur besonders hochwertig ist. In den Bergen bei Macka thront auch das historische Sumela-Kloster, das sich wie ein Adlerhorst in eine Felswand schmiegt und Zeugnis einer jahrhundertealten christlichen Tradition ist. An den regenreichen Hangen von Rize fuhrt die Reise zu den beruhmten Teeplantagen. Hier wachst das Nationalgetrank der Turken: √áay, den die Einheimischen mit Stolz und in groSSen Mengen genieSSen. In Artvin pflegt Falkner Kazim die alte Kunst der Greifvogeljagd. Mit seinem Wanderfalken bewahrt er eine tief verwurzelte Tradition, die die enge Beziehung zwischen den Menschen hier und der ungezahmten Natur widerspiegelt. Bekannt ist die Region auch fur ihre Stierkampfe auf der Ayder-Alm, wo die Tiere unter der strengen Aufsicht ihrer stolzen Besitzer um die Rangordnung kampfen.

<title>Kloake statt Strandidylle an englischen Kusten</title>
<desc>Whitstable ist bekannt fur seine frischen Austern und die malerische Kuste. Doch die Idylle ist bedroht: Mit Fakalien verseuchtes Abwasser verschmutzt die Nordsee und wird zur Gesundheitsgefahr fur Anwohner und Touristen. Die leidenschaftliche Schwimmerin Catherine Chapman pruft mittlerweile vor jedem Gang in die Nordsee mithilfe einer App, ob das Schwimmen fur sie gefahrlich werden kann. Aus Wut uber die Verschmutzung des Wassers grundete die Pilates-Lehrerin 2021 gemeinsam mit Freunden die Protestgruppe "SOS-Whitstable". Die privaten Wasserversorger in England investierten lange zu wenig in den Ausbau des Kanalsystems, wahrend die Bevolkerung stetig wuchs. Heute ist das Netz insbesondere bei Regen oft uberlastet. Das fuhrt dazu, dass immer wieder ungeklartes Abwasser in britische Gewasser abgeleitet wird. Allein im Jahr 2023 wurden in England mehr als 450.000 solcher Vorfalle registriert. Fur Whitstable sind die Folgen gravierend. Fischer wie Philip Edwards leiden unter der Verschmutzung der Nordsee und dem Schwund der Meerestiere in der Region. Auch die Austernzucht, das Markenzeichen des Stadtchens, ist betroffen: Die Austern mussen tagelang in Reinigungstanks gelagert werden, bevor sie fur den Verzehr freigegeben werden konnen. Die Abwassereinleitungen sind landesweit ein Problem. Im November 2024 schlieSSen sich uber 10.000 Menschen zusammen, um in London zu protestieren.

<desc>(1): In Kambodscha: Philong Sovans geheimes Phnom Penh Als Philong Sovan im Alter von sechs Jahren aus der kambodschanischen Provinz in die Hauptstadt Phnom Penh zog, fand er dort nicht nur ein neues Zuhause, sondern auch ein schier unbegrenztes Terrain fur sein kunftiges kunstlerisches Schaffen. Etwa drei Jahrzehnte spater zahlt Sovan zu den wichtigsten Vertretern der zeitgenossischen asiatischen Fotografie. Seine halb dokumentarischen, halb inszenierten Aufnahmen zeigen auch ungeschonten Perspektiven und enthullen die geheimsten Winkel der kambodschanischen Hauptstadt. (2): In Marokko: Stolze Akrobaten Auf den Platzen der marokkanischen Medinas und an den Stranden des Konigreichs trifft man immer wieder nomadische Zirkusakrobaten an, die den Stolz der Nation verkorpern. Die waghalsigen und agilen Athleten stehen fur jene Art von Erfolg, der auf harter Arbeit und Willensstarke beruht. Ihre Akrobatik ist mehr als eine Zirkusnummer unter freiem Himmel: Sie hat ihre Wurzeln im religiosen Glauben und in der Geschichte des Landes. (3): In den USA: Vitos Spaghetti mit TomatensoSSe und Hackballchen In New York nehmen sich Vito und Federico ein Rezept vor, das die Amerikaner fur einen Klassiker der italienischen Kuche halten. Zuerst formen sie Hackballchen aus Rind- und Schweinefleisch. Fur die NudelsoSSe lassen sie Tomaten, Knoblauch, Zwiebeln und Petersilie kocheln und geben schlieSSlich die Hackballchen hinzu. Die Spaghetti werden in der SoSSe bissfest gekocht. (4): In Sydney: Von der Erfindung des Flugschreibers Botany Bay sudlich von Sydney beherbergt den groSSten Flughafen der australischen Metropole. Wenn Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts ein Flugzeug verschwand oder absturzte, war es schier unmoglich, den Ursachen auf die Spur zu kommen.

<sub-title>Sizilien / Armenien / Cork</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Sizilien: Die Prufungen des Odysseus Vom Meer aus wirkt Sizilien wie ein Bollwerk zwischen Gottern und Sterblichen. Hier durchlebte Odysseus auf seiner Irrfahrt durch das Mittelmeer einige der schlimmsten gottlichen Prufungen. In den Versen der "Odyssee", die Homer zugeschrieben werden, verwandeln sich die felsigen Landschaften der Insel in Ungeheuer, die den griechischen Helden und seine Manner zu verschlingen drohen. Kaum ist Odysseus dort dem Zyklopen Polyphem entkommen, muss er sich dem Zorn Poseidons stellen. Nachdem er in einem erbitterten Kampf die grausamen Ungeheuer Skylla und Charybdis bezwungen hat, nimmt der Held seinen Kurs nach Ithaka wieder auf - den Gottern zum Trotz. (2): Armenien: Land der Moderne In den 1960er Jahren veranderten modernistische Gebaude das Erscheinungsbild der Sowjetrepublik Armenien. 1961 war Juri Gagarin als erster Mensch in den Weltraum geflogen, und das Weltraumfieber ergriff Architekten in der gesamten Sowjetunion - besonders in Armenien. Die Hauptstadt Eriwan war einst eine kleine Provinzstadt, die auch unter dem Namen Jerewan bekannt ist. Sie wurde zum architektonischen Experimentierfeld, wo ausgesprochen moderne Flughafen, Bahnhofe und Konzerthallen aus dem Boden schossen. Manche davon wirken wie am Ende der Welt gestrandete Raumschiffe. (3): Guatemala: Clemencias Schokobananen An den Ufern des Atitl√°n-Sees bereitet Clemencia Pl√°tanos en mole zu. Dafur kocht sie zunachst Bananen und stellt dann eine wurzige SoSSe aus gegrillten Tomaten, Paprika und Chilischoten her, in die sie gerostete Kurbiskerne und Sesam gibt. Nachdem sie das Ganze im Mixer fein puriert hat, schmeckt Clemencia die SoSSe mit Schokolade, Zucker und Salz ab. Damit werden die Bananen uberzogen - fertig! (4): Cork: Ein Schwur auf Enthaltsamkeit Zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts erlebte Irland einen regelrechten Whisky-Boom.

<desc>Abseits des gangigen Karibik-Klischees uberrascht St. Kitts durch schwarze Strande und hohe Berge. Ruinen von Zuckermuhlen und Herrenhausern erinnern an die Kolonialzeit, als versklavte Afrikaner Knochenarbeit leisten mussten, und die Weltkulturerbe-Festung Brimstone Hill an Seeschlachten zwischen Englandern und Franzosen. Die St. Kitts Scenic Railway zahlt zu den wenigen Eisenbahnen der Kleinen Antillen. Bei einer Fahrt auf den Gleisen der ehemaligen Zuckerrohrbahn geht es an der Atlantikkuste uber Schluchten. Im urwuchsigen Norden beeindruckt ein erloschener Vulkan. Heimische Schildkroten und eingewanderte Affen bevolkern die tropische Natur. Menschen entlang der Strecke machen mit ihrer Kultur und den Brauchen vertraut. Zu Ostern lassen sie Drachen steigen und bereiten aus SuSSkartoffeln Conkies zu. Neben den Klangen von Steeldrums ist auch ein beruhmtes Kirchenlied mit St. Kitts verbunden: John Newton beteiligte sich hier am Sklavenhandel und schrieb spater gelautert "Amazing Grace".</desc>

<sub-title>Toskanischer Archipel</sub-title>
<desc>Im groSSten Meeresschutzgebiet Europas liegt der Toskanische Archipel, zu dem die Inseln Elba, Montecristo und Capraia gehoren. Auch groSSe Landflachen stehen unter Schutz und sind als Nationalpark ausgewiesen. Elba, die groSSte und bekannteste Insel des Archipels, wird vor allem als Urlaubsinsel geschatzt. Dabei galt die Insel bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wegen ihrer reichen Eisenerzvorkommen als das Ruhrgebiet Europas. Als der Bergbau nicht mehr rentabel war, wurde er vom Tourismus abgelost. Dabei hat die Insel weit mehr zu bieten als glasklares Wasser und lange Strande: eine reiche Geschichte, denn schon den Etruskern war Elba bekannt, dann kamen die Romer, die Medici und schlieSSlich Napoleon. Und die Tier- und Pflanzenwelt ist vielseitig. Montecristo wurde durch den Roman "Der Graf von Monte Christo" weltberuhmt. 63 Kilometer vom italienischen Festland entfernt ragt das menschenleere Inselchen wie ein steiler Granitfelsen aus dem Wasser. Allein Wissenschaftlern und Wissenschaftlerinnen ist der Zutritt erlaubt. Nur hier lebt die Montecristo-Ziege und die giftigste Schlange Europas, die Montecristo-Viper. Dazu kommt eine Vielzahl an endemischen Reptilien, Schnecken und Pflanzen. Die Insel Capraia hat eine ganz besondere Pflanzenwelt, bedingt durch die Entfernung zum Kontinent und die Lage mitten im Mittelmeer. √úber 400 Pflanzenarten wachsen hier, mehr als die Insel Einwohner hat.

<title>Die Vogelretter von Linosa</title>
<desc>Tagsuber sind die Vogel fast nicht zu beobachten. Nur nachts kann man an Land die ungewohnlichen, fast jammernden Rufe der Sepiasturmtaucher horen. Die geheimnisvollen Vogel legen im Jahr 40- bis 50.000 Kilometer uber dem Atlantik zuruck. Zwischen Februar und Oktober kommen sie fur die Brutsaison nach Europa. Auf der kleinen italienischen Vulkaninsel Linosa sudlich von Sizilien lebt eine der groSSten Kolonien von Sepiasturmtauchern im Mittelmeer. Jedes Jahr arbeitet der italienische Wissenschaftler Giacomo DellOmo fur mehrere Monate auf der Insel, um die Kolonie zu schutzen. Mittlerweile wird er von seiner Tochter Eleonora unterstutzt. Sepiasturmtaucher werden bis zu 50 Zentimeter lang und haben eine Flugelspannweite von ungefahr 115 Zentimeter. Mannchen und Weibchen bebruten ab Mai in schwer zuganglichen Hohlen und Felsspalten abwechselnd ein einziges Ei pro Saison, wahrend der andere Partner weit hinaus ubers Meer fliegt, um nach Nahrung zu suchen. Invasive Arten wie Ratten und Katzen bedrohen die Vogel. Der Mensch, der vor 150 Jahren nach Linosa kam, hat den Lebensraum der Vogel immer weiter eingeschrankt. Die zunehmend heiSSeren Sommer machen den Tieren ebenso zu schaffen wie die Gefahr durch die Fischerei-Industrie. In deren Netzen und Haken verenden viele Vogel. Gemeinsam mit der Wissenschaftlerin Stefania Casagrande vom "Max-Planck Institut fur biologische Intelligenz" sammelt Giacomo DellOmo in einem Pilotprojekt Daten uber die Verbreitung der Vogel, um sie besser zu schutzen. GPS-Sender und neuartige Bluetooth-Sender sollen dabei helfen.</desc>

<title>Die neuen, jungen Jager</title>
<desc>Um 36 Prozent ist die Zahl der Jager seit den 1990er Jahren in Deutschland angestiegen - auf gut 436.000. In speziell auf junge Kundschaft ausgerichteten Jagdschulen buffeln die Anwarterinnen und Anwarter Pflanzen- und Tierlekture, lernen schieSSen, und entdecken - auch mit Hilfe von Wildfluencern - alte Werte und Tugenden wie Verantwortung, Disziplin und die Hege und Pflege der Wildtiere wieder. Allen gemeinsam ist: Es geht ihnen weniger um das "Erlegen" von Tieren, sondern mehr um das naturnahe Erlebnis. Doch manche der "Intensiv-Kurse" kratzen allzu sehr an der Oberflache - so die Kritik aus den Verbanden. Vor allem, da es auch an Revieren fur die vielen neuen Absolventen mangelt, um ihr frisch erworbenes Wissen anwenden zu konnen. Abhilfe verspricht Claudia Breit, studierte Psychologin und Jagerin aus Oberfranken. Sie bietet Coaching-Seminare an mit Fokus auf die Schussangst und versteht sich selbst als "Wilganerin", die kein Fleisch isst - bis auf selbst erlegtes Wild. Daruber hinaus will sie der Jagd auf ihrem Instagram-Account ein zeitgemaSSes Podium bieten, auf dem auch uber kritische Themen diskutiert werden kann. Jan-Philipp Konig wiederum will seine private Jagdakademie in Nordrhein-Westfalen weiter ausbauen. Kunftig soll es dort auch Fortbildungskurse geben, die man im Anschluss an die Kompaktkurse buchen kann und die das Wissen vertiefen. Oliver Wolf vom Netzwerk "Wald mit Wild" wiederum engagiert sich ehrenamtlich fur ein modernes Wildtiermanagement, das auch den Artenschutz mehr in den Blick nimmt. Seine Leidenschaft gilt dem Niederwild, vor allem dem Fasan.</desc>

<title>Geheimakte Rudolf Steiner - Anthroposoph, Okkultist, Influencer?</title>
<desc>Vor hundert Jahren starb Rudolf Steiner, der Vater der Anthroposophie. Auf seinen Theorien basieren Waldorfschulen, Demeter-Landwirtschaft oder Naturkosmetik. Sie sorgen, ebenso wie die Person selbst, bis heute fur Kontroversen. Doch wer war dieser Visionar und Firmengrunder? Was pragte ihn und trieb ihn an? Die Dokumentation enthullt Steiners Lebensweg, wie er sich vom armen Studenten in Wien zum Goethe-Herausgeber in Weimar hocharbeitet und in der Berliner Boh√®me um 1900 in eine wilde Kunst- und Literaturszene abtaucht, wo er zwischen Tabakrauch und Cognac zeitweilig sogar mit dem Anarchismus sympathisiert. Der selbst ernannte Hellseher findet in einem okkulten Zirkel ein Publikum, das wie gebannt an seinen Lippen hangt. Bald ist sein Erfolg nicht mehr aufzuhalten, seine Reformbewegung erhalt regen Zulauf. Warum wird Steiner von den einen vergottert und von anderen gehasst? Wie sieht die Staatsmacht einen Mann, der zur Jahrhundertwende Schule, Landwirtschaft, Kirche und Staat neu denkt? Akten in einem Geheimarchiv zeugen von seiner Vergangenheit, selbst im Ausland hat man Steiner im Blick. Obwohl er rassistische und antisemitische Aussagen tatigt, mit denen seine Anhanger damals wie heute konfrontiert werden, wird er selbst zur Zielscheibe rechtsnationaler Gewalt. Der Film zeigt wenig bekannte Facetten Steiners: akademisches Scheitern, pikante Beziehungsdramen, esoterische Erleuchtungen, aber auch seinen Sinn fur Marketing und Grundertum. 100 Jahre nach seinem Tod bleibt die Frage: Wer war Rudolf Steiner?</desc>

<sub-title>Neapel: Leben am FuSSe des Vesuvs</sub-title>
<desc>Neapel, die drittgroSSte Stadt Italiens, wird von zwei aktiven Vulkanen umrahmt. Einer von ihnen ist der Vesuv, der wohl beruhmteste Vulkan der Welt: Die Folgen seines Ausbruchs im Jahr 79 nach Christus, der Pompeji, Stabiae und Herculaneum unter einem riesigen Ascheberg begrub, sind in der Region noch heute sichtbar. Seine legendare Zerstorungskraft lockt Millionen Touristen an, obwohl die Gefahr noch nicht gebannt ist: Je langer der Vulkan schlaft, desto groSSer wird der Druck und desto explosiver kann der nachste Ausbruch werden. Als 1944 in Europa der Zweite Weltkrieg tobte, brach auch der Vulkan aus. Die Eruption forderte 26 Opfer und machte 12.000 Menschen obdachlos. Auf der anderen Seite der Stadt befindet sich eine weitere Bedrohung: die Phlegraischen Felder. Durch unterirdische Magmaflusse und sich erwarmende Gesteinsschichten hebt und senkt sich das Gelande der anliegenden Stadt Pozzuoli - ein seltenes Phanomen. Innerhalb von 15 Jahren hat sich der Erdboden der Gegend gehoben, was sogar zur Evakuierung eines Stadtteils fuhrte. Doch die knapp eine Million Neapolitaner haben gelernt, mit den unberechenbaren Nachbarn zu leben, aber auch die Ressourcen fur sich zu nutzen, wie das vulkanische Tuffgestein. Zusammen mit dem Geologen Vincenzo Albertini besucht Arnaud ein Stollenlabyrinth 40 Meter unter der Stadt, wo das Gestein abgebaut wurde. Alles, was hier fehlt, wurde benutzt, um die Hauser zu bauen. Es ist wie ein Negativabdruck von Neapel. Die Vulkane sind fur die Bewohner zugleich Wohltater und Gefahr, doch der allgegenwartigen Bedrohung begegnen die Neapolitaner mit Dolce Vita. Als wollten sie den Vulkanen, die ihnen jederzeit alles nehmen konnen, eine lange Nase ziehen.</desc>

Zum Hohepunkt der Trockenzeit bereitet sich das malerische Dorf El Roc√≠o auf die Saca de las Yeguas vor. Tausende Zuschauer verfolgen den traditionellen Zusammentrieb der halbwilden Marisme√±o-Stuten, einer der altesten Pferderassen der Welt. Die Sumpfe, in denen die Pferde weiden, trocknen uber Monate hinweg aus und werden erst in der Regenzeit wieder geflutet. Millionen Zugvogel rasten ganzjahrig in der Region. Als wichtiger Knotenpunkt zwischen Afrika und Europa finden sie in den Gewassern des Do√±ana ausreichend Nahrung. Menschen, Flora und Fauna leben hier im Rhythmus des Wassers, das die Landschaft entscheidend pragt. Doch im Nationalpark herrscht nur scheinbar unberuhrte Wildnis. Seit den 1950er-Jahren breitet sich die Intensivlandwirtschaft immer weiter aus. In einer Zeit, in der Umweltfragen noch keine Rolle spielten, wurde das √ñkosystem durch Trockenlegung und Wasserumleitung stark beeintrachtigt. Angesichts zunehmender Durreperioden steht die Region vor der Herausforderung, sich neu zu erfinden, um langfristig zu uberleben. Heute erproben Einheimische und Forschende im Nationalpark gemeinsam, wie sie den Anforderungen des 21. Jahrhunderts begegnen und diesen andalusischen Naturschatz bewahren konnen.</desc>

<sub-title>Rooibos: der rote Tee Sudafrikas</sub-title>
<desc>Die Rooibos-Pflanze wachst nur in der Gegend um die Zederberge. Alle Versuche, sie in anderen Landern der Welt anzubauen, sind gescheitert. Wann genau die Khoi San, die Ureinwohner des sudlichen Afrikas, die Rooibos-Pflanze und deren Nutzung als Teegetrank entdeckt haben, ist nicht genau belegt. Jedoch ist der Herstellungsprozess seit Jahrhunderten gleich geblieben: Der frisch geerntete, noch grune Rooibos muss geschnitten, zerdruckt und zum Fermentieren angehauft werden. Erst dann wird er in der sudafrikanischen Sonne getrocknet. Nur wenn all das richtig ablauft, erhalt der Tee seine typische, ziegelrote Farbung. Maans Fortuin ist Farmer in einer Kooperative, seit fruhester Kindheit begleitet ihn der Rooibos. Der Tee ist fur ihn viel mehr als nur ein Produkt: "Das Schonste fur mich ist, wenn ich eine volle Ernte sehe. Das ist fur mich groSSartig. Ich bin stolz und glucklich. Es spult Geld in die Taschen der Bauern, es verandert das Leben der √Ñrmsten der Armen - es bringt Essen auf ihren Tisch ‚Ä¶"√úberall in der Provinz Westkap wurden in den letzten Jahren Kooperativen von Kleinbauern gegrundet, sie produzieren Tee mit Bio-Zertifikat - und "handmade". Der Tee freut sich weltweit groSSer Beliebtheit, nicht zuletzt wegen seiner guten Eigenschaften - er ist komplett koffeinfrei und seine entzundungshemmende Wirkung ist medizinisch belegt. Mit viel Lebensmut und Kreativitat bewaltigen die Rooibos-Bauern den Alltag. Doch die ohnehin harte Arbeit wird in diesem Jahr zusatzlich durch die anhaltende Trockenheit belastet - der Wassermangel macht allen schwer zu schaffen.</desc>

<sub-title>Deutschland: Aalsuppe</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Aalsuppe, ein Stuck Hamburg im Loffel An den Ufern der Elbe macht sich unser Journalist Alexis Sarini auf die Spuren eines Fisches, der in der Geschichte und Gastronomie Hamburgs eine wichtige Rolle spielt: der Aal. Er geht gemeinsam mit Thomas Sampl angeln und darf anschlieSSend die Aalsuppe des sympathischen Fernsehkochs kosten. Der Geograph und Ernahrungswissenschaftler Pierre Raffard beleuchtet die Geschichte des Fischfangs in Hamburg, die Rolle der Krauter in der Aalsuppe und die Geheimnisse der nachhaltigen Nutzung des Aalbestandes. (2): Nostalgiegeschmack: Jorg, ein Deutscher in Georgien Jorg stammt aus Deutschland und lebt seit 2009 in Georgien. Fur seine Freunde bereitet er einen Karpfen zu. Dabei erzahlt er von der Natur Georgiens und von den Gerichten, die ihn an seine Kindheit in Deutschland erinnern. (3): Ran an die Topfe! Appetit bekommen?

<desc>(1): In Kambodscha: Philong Sovans geheimes Phnom Penh Als Philong Sovan im Alter von sechs Jahren aus der kambodschanischen Provinz in die Hauptstadt Phnom Penh zog, fand er dort nicht nur ein neues Zuhause, sondern auch ein schier unbegrenztes Terrain fur sein kunftiges kunstlerisches Schaffen. Etwa drei Jahrzehnte spater zahlt Sovan zu den wichtigsten Vertretern der zeitgenossischen asiatischen Fotografie. Seine halb dokumentarischen, halb inszenierten Aufnahmen zeigen auch ungeschonten Perspektiven und enthullen die geheimsten Winkel der kambodschanischen Hauptstadt. (2): In Marokko: Stolze Akrobaten Auf den Platzen der marokkanischen Medinas und an den Stranden des Konigreichs trifft man immer wieder nomadische Zirkusakrobaten an, die den Stolz der Nation verkorpern. Die waghalsigen und agilen Athleten stehen fur jene Art von Erfolg, der auf harter Arbeit und Willensstarke beruht. Ihre Akrobatik ist mehr als eine Zirkusnummer unter freiem Himmel: Sie hat ihre Wurzeln im religiosen Glauben und in der Geschichte des Landes. (3): In den USA: Vitos Spaghetti mit TomatensoSSe und Hackballchen In New York nehmen sich Vito und Federico ein Rezept vor, das die Amerikaner fur einen Klassiker der italienischen Kuche halten. Zuerst formen sie Hackballchen aus Rind- und Schweinefleisch. Fur die NudelsoSSe lassen sie Tomaten, Knoblauch, Zwiebeln und Petersilie kocheln und geben schlieSSlich die Hackballchen hinzu. Die Spaghetti werden in der SoSSe bissfest gekocht. (4): In Sydney: Von der Erfindung des Flugschreibers Botany Bay sudlich von Sydney beherbergt den groSSten Flughafen der australischen Metropole. Wenn Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts ein Flugzeug verschwand oder absturzte, war es schier unmoglich, den Ursachen auf die Spur zu kommen. Nachdem sein Vater bei einem Flugzeugabsturz ums Leben gekommen war, beschloss ein kleiner Junge in den 1930er Jahren alles daran zu setzen, um diesen Missstand aus der Welt zu schaffen ‚Ä¶</desc>

<sub-title>Sizilien / Armenien / Cork</sub-title>
<desc>(1): Sizilien: Die Prufungen des Odysseus Vom Meer aus wirkt Sizilien wie ein Bollwerk zwischen Gottern und Sterblichen. Hier durchlebte Odysseus auf seiner Irrfahrt durch das Mittelmeer einige der schlimmsten gottlichen Prufungen. In den Versen der "Odyssee", die Homer zugeschrieben werden, verwandeln sich die felsigen Landschaften der Insel in Ungeheuer, die den griechischen Helden und seine Manner zu verschlingen drohen. Kaum ist Odysseus dort dem Zyklopen Polyphem entkommen, muss er sich dem Zorn Poseidons stellen. Nachdem er in einem erbitterten Kampf die grausamen Ungeheuer Skylla und Charybdis bezwungen hat, nimmt der Held seinen Kurs nach Ithaka wieder auf - den Gottern zum Trotz. (2): Armenien: Land der Moderne In den 1960er Jahren veranderten modernistische Gebaude das Erscheinungsbild der Sowjetrepublik Armenien. 1961 war Juri Gagarin als erster Mensch in den Weltraum geflogen, und das Weltraumfieber ergriff Architekten in der gesamten Sowjetunion - besonders in Armenien. Die Hauptstadt Eriwan war einst eine kleine Provinzstadt, die auch unter dem Namen Jerewan bekannt ist. Sie wurde zum architektonischen Experimentierfeld, wo ausgesprochen moderne Flughafen, Bahnhofe und Konzerthallen aus dem Boden schossen. Manche davon wirken wie am Ende der Welt gestrandete Raumschiffe. (3): Guatemala: Clemencias Schokobananen An den Ufern des Atitl√°n-Sees bereitet Clemencia Pl√°tanos en mole zu. Dafur kocht sie zunachst Bananen und stellt dann eine wurzige SoSSe aus gegrillten Tomaten, Paprika und Chilischoten her, in die sie gerostete Kurbiskerne und Sesam gibt. Nachdem sie das Ganze im Mixer fein puriert hat, schmeckt Clemencia die SoSSe mit Schokolade, Zucker und Salz ab. Damit werden die Bananen uberzogen - fertig! (4): Cork: Ein Schwur auf Enthaltsamkeit Zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts erlebte Irland einen regelrechten Whisky-Boom. In der Hochzeit der Industriellen Revolution explodierte die Zahl der Destillerien, und die Arbeiterklasse gab sich dem taglichen Rausch hin. Angesichts dieser Ausschweifungen lancierte die Kirche eine Gegenbewegung, die MaSSigung propagierte ‚Ä¶</desc>

<title>Die Sonne</title>
<desc>Die Sonne ist das Wunder, das alles begrundet - aber auch die groSSte Gefahr. Der sprichwortliche Fixstern des Sonnensystems. Erstmals widmet sich ein abendfullender Dokumentarfilm der Suche nach der Bedeutung des Heimatsterns fur Mensch, Wissenschaft und Natur. Denn die Suche nach der Sonne ist zugleich die Suche nach der groSSten aller Fragen: Was ist Leben? Wer wusste das besser als der Brite Andy Keen, der einem Phanomen der Sonne sein Leben verschrieben hat. Den "Indiana Jones der Nordlichter" verschlagt es in die Finnmarksvidda, das Gebiet mit den tiefsten Temperaturen im norwegischen Winter. Dort begegnen die indigenen Einwohner des Nordens, die Samen, ihrem Heimatstern mit dem Respekt eines naturverbundenen Volks. Sie haben uber 600 Worte fur den Schnee. Aber nur ein Wort fur die Sonne. Ein unsichtbares Band verbindet die Sonne mit der Erde. Die Natur richtet sich danach aus. Die Tierwelt. Und der Mensch. Doch wenn die Erde brennt, ist kein Leben moglich. Je weiter die Wissenschaft der Spur der Sonne folgt, desto naher kommt sie dem Ende. Davon berichten Forscherinnen und Forscher bei der amerikanischen Weltraumbehorde NASA, an den kanarischen Observatorien Teide und Roque de los Muchachos und am heiSSesten Ort des Planeten, dem Tal des Todes, wo die Thermometer im Juli regelmaSSig uber 50 Grad Celsius anzeigen. Noch nie in der Geschichte der Menschheit war es wichtiger, den Geheimnissen der Sonne auf die Spur zu kommen. Denn fur die Erde ist die Sonne nicht irgendein Stern. Sie ist der Stern schlechthin.</desc>

<sub-title>Tatianas Tanz: Akrobatik auf dem Hochseil</sub-title>
<desc>Tatiana-Mosio Bongonga lebt mit ihrer dreijahrigen Tochter und der von ihr gegrundeten Artistengruppe in einem pittoresken Dorf am FuSSe der Cevennen. Der Film begleitet sie beim Training in den Tagen vor ihrem groSSen Auftritt am Stadion "Stade de France" vor den Toren von Paris. Fur Tatiana ist der bevorstehende Auftritt eine technische, kunstlerische und menschliche Herausforderung. Um sie herum ist ein ganzes Team im Einsatz. In Saint-Denis kummert sich ihr Kompagnon und Mitstreiter Jan Naets drei Tage lang mit funf Seilkletterern allein um die aufwendige Installation des Seils und die Einweisung des Bodenpersonals zur Absicherung. Seiltanz ist ein standiges Ausloten der Grenzen zwischen Erdanziehungskraft und akrobatischer Eleganz: Die Artistin beherrscht das Gleichgewicht, das es ihr ermoglicht, sich tanzerisch vorwartszubewegen, ohne in die Tiefe zu sturzen. Es ist eine Zirkuskunst, die sowohl die Darstellerin als auch das Publikum in ihren Bann zieht. Tatianas Anmut und ihre kalkulierte Risikobereitschaft ziehen alle Blicke auf sich. Jede Darbietung auf dem Hochseil ist ein luftiges und tanzerisches Abenteuer, begleitet von einpragsamer Live-Musik begleitet wird, aber auch von zahlreichen Helfern, die zur Stabilisierung des Seils beteiligen. Kein Zuschauer kann sich der Faszination eines scheinbar schwerelos zwischen Himmel und Erde balancierenden Menschen entziehen.</desc>

<title>Die neuen, jungen Jager</title>
<desc>Um 36 Prozent ist die Zahl der Jager seit den 1990er Jahren in Deutschland angestiegen - auf gut 436.000. In speziell auf junge Kundschaft ausgerichteten Jagdschulen buffeln die Anwarterinnen und Anwarter Pflanzen- und Tierlekture, lernen schieSSen, und entdecken - auch mit Hilfe von Wildfluencern - alte Werte und Tugenden wie Verantwortung, Disziplin und die Hege und Pflege der Wildtiere wieder. Allen gemeinsam ist: Es geht ihnen weniger um das "Erlegen" von Tieren, sondern mehr um das naturnahe Erlebnis. Doch manche der "Intensiv-Kurse" kratzen allzu sehr an der Oberflache - so die Kritik aus den Verbanden. Vor allem, da es auch an Revieren fur die vielen neuen Absolventen mangelt, um ihr frisch erworbenes Wissen anwenden zu konnen. Abhilfe verspricht Claudia Breit, studierte Psychologin und Jagerin aus Oberfranken. Sie bietet Coaching-Seminare an mit Fokus auf die Schussangst und versteht sich selbst als "Wilganerin", die kein Fleisch isst - bis auf selbst erlegtes Wild. Daruber hinaus will sie der Jagd auf ihrem Instagram-Account ein zeitgemaSSes Podium bieten, auf dem auch uber kritische Themen diskutiert werden kann. Jan-Philipp Konig wiederum will seine private Jagdakademie in Nordrhein-Westfalen weiter ausbauen. Kunftig soll es dort auch Fortbildungskurse geben, die man im Anschluss an die Kompaktkurse buchen kann und die das Wissen vertiefen. Oliver Wolf vom Netzwerk "Wald mit Wild" wiederum engagiert sich ehrenamtlich fur ein modernes Wildtiermanagement, das auch den Artenschutz mehr in den Blick nimmt. Seine Leidenschaft gilt dem Niederwild, vor allem dem Fasan.</desc>

<desc>Seit Jahrtausenden verzaubert die Rose mit ihrer Schonheit und ihrem betorenden Duft. Aus den Bluten der Damaszener Rose wird ein kostbares Gut gewonnen: Rosenol. Im bulgarischen Tal der Rosen bewirtschaften Boris und Keti Katsarski ihr eigenes Feld. In der Destillerie werden die Rosenblatter zu Rosenol und Rosenwasser weiterverarbeitet. Die Reise fuhrt auch in die Vergangenheit: Im antiken Rom waren Rosen ein Statussymbol und Inbegriff von Luxus. √úber die SeidenstraSSe gelangte die √ñlrose ursprunglich nach Europa. Heute sind Rosen nicht nur in der Parfum- und Kosmetikindustrie gefragt, sondern finden auch in der Kuche Verwendung. Lucie zeigt, wie man die Blutenblatter kandiert und zu einem erfrischenden Rosen-Kratzeis verarbeitet - eine kostliche Hommage an die Konigin der Blumen.</desc>

In ihrem 2011 erschienenen Roman will sie die Wunden ihrer eigenen und der chilenischen Geschichte heilen. (2): In Westaustralien: Kunst als Therapie fur die Aborigines Die Tragodie der Noongar reiht sich in die unzahligen Traumata ein, welche die indigenen Volker Australiens erleiden mussten. Von Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts bis in die 1970er Jahre wurden Zehntausende Noongar-Kinder aus ihren Familien herausgerissen und gewaltsam adoptiert, um "WeiSSe" aus ihnen zu machen. Heute wird im Reha-Zentrum von Carrolup im Westen des Landes versucht, diese verlorene Generation mit Hilfe von Kunst zu heilen.

Zunachst mussen die Kerne etwa 48 Stunden lang eingeweicht werden, dann kommen sie in den Mixer.

<desc>(1): Turkei: Crossing the Bridge mit Fatih Akin Filme zwischen zwei Ufern, zwei Kulturen, zwei Landern - der Turkei und Deutschland: Das Werk von Fatih Akin schlagt die Brucke zwischen "hier" und "dort". Der 1973 in Hamburg als Sohn turkischer Einwanderer geborene Regisseur reflektiert Fragen der Identitat mit dem Blick eines AuSSenstehenden. Der Film "Gegen die Wand" (2004) wurde zum Aushangeschild eines gelungenen Multikulturalismus. Mit seinen Filmen zeigt Akin die Turkei, wie er sie erlebt: Menschen in Bewegung und Kulturen, die aufeinanderprallen. Dabei beleuchtet Akin das beschwerliche Leben all derer, die sich in dem Land, in dem sie leben, fremd fuhlen. (2): Kaffee, das Gold der Osmanen In der Turkei ist Kaffee mehr als ein Getrank, er ist fester Bestandteil der Kultur. Seit dem 16. Jahrhundert gilt er als Quell der Kraft und Tugend ebenso wie des Lasters. Kaffee war ein Instrument der Macht, aber auch der Demokratisierung. Er brachte einen Wind der Freiheit uber Konstantinopel, und in den finstersten Stunden des Osmanischen Reiches gab manch einer sein Leben fur eine Tasse Kaffee. (3): Turkei: Aylins Kalbfleisch-Ravioli mit Joghurt und Tomaten In Istanbul bereitet Aylin turkische Ravioli zu. Wahrend der selbstgemachte Teigt ruht, ruhrt sie die Fullung aus Kalbshack, Zwiebeln und Piment. Die Teigtaschchen werden von Hand gefullt und anschlieSSend in Wasser gekocht. Aylin serviert ihre Ravioli mit Joghurt, den sie zuvor mit Knoblauch gewurzt hat, sowie einer SoSSe aus Butter und Tomaten. Ein leckerer Klassiker der turkischen Kuche! (4): Istanbul: Briefe aus dem Hamam 1453 verwandelte sich das christliche Konstantinopel - das heutige Istanbul - in die muslimische Hauptstadt der Sultane. In der Stadt wuchsen Moscheen, Palaste und Hamams in den Himmel, wahrend die Europaer ein von eigenen Sehnsuchten gepragtes Orientklischee entwickelten.

<title>Paris, Hauptstadt der Bienen</title>
<desc>In Paris fallt es den fleiSSigen Insekten leicht, Nahrung zu finden, auch dank der uber das ganze Jahr verteilten Blutezeiten. Die abwechslungsreiche Stadtvegetation bietet den Bienen eine Nahrungsvielfalt, die es auf dem Land aufgrund von Monokulturen haufig nicht mehr gibt. Zudem wurde in Paris entschieden, den Gebrauch von Pestiziden ganz einzustellen. Selbst vom Aussterben bedroht, ist die Biene damit zum Symbol des Erhalts der Biodiversitat geworden. Eines der Habitate der Honigbienen von Paris existiert schon seit rund 400 Jahren: der Jardin des Plantes, ein botanischer Garten. Hier finden sich, etwas versteckt, Bienenstocke, die von der Gartnerin Vanessa Voskobo√Ønikoff umsorgt werden. Abseits der √ñffentlichkeit wahnt man sich weit drauSSen auf dem Land, und doch ist man mitten im Herzen von Paris. Ruhe ist fur die Tiere auch in der Stadt wichtig. Die Honigbiene ist ein sogenanntes staatenbildendes Insekt. Sie kann nur in der Gemeinschaft leben. In der Hochsaison zahlt ein Bienenstock etwa 50.000 Bienen und produziert im Schnitt 30 Kilogramm Honig. Um zu wissen, wann es Zeit ist zu ernten, uberprufen die Imker mit Hilfe eines Refraktometers den Feuchtigkeitsgehalt. Auch der Parc de la Villette beheimatet Bienenstocke in einem Schulbauernhof. Hier betreibt der junge Imker Pierre Merlet ein engagiertes Bienenprojekt. Er gewinnt Honig und klart nebenher regelmaSSig interessierte Gruppen uber das Wohl und die Probleme der Honigbienen auf. Pierre hat die aktuellen okologischen Herausforderungen im Blick. Er liebt es, sein Wissen und seine Leidenschaft mit anderen zu teilen.</desc>

Die Sendung erzahlt von Georg Schmidt, einem deutschen Einwanderer, der seinen Platz in der boomenden Metropole am Hudson River sucht. Georg ist einer von Hunderttausenden Deutschen, die in New York eine neue Heimat fanden. Nach Wien und Berlin galt die Stadt als eines der Zentren deutscher Einwanderung weltweit. Viele von ihnen hatten ihre Heimat in der Hoffnung auf sozialen Aufstieg und bessere Lebensbedingungen verlassen. Auch Georg traumt von einer groSSen Zukunft: Er mochte Anwalt werden. In New York scheint dieser Traum greifbar, denn eine dreijahrige Ausbildung bei einem erfahrenen Anwalt reicht aus - ein Studium ist nicht zwingend erforderlich. Doch dieser Tag halt groSSe Herausforderungen fur ihn bereit. Beruflich steht er unter Druck, denn er muss fur einen Prozess uber Bandenkriminalitat noch einen entscheidenden Zeugen finden. Gleichzeitig wartet am Hafen ein ganz personlicher Moment: Nach Monaten der Trennung ist seine Verlobte endlich aus Deutschland angekommen, um mit Georg ein neues Leben zu beginnen. Das Wiedersehen nimmt jedoch eine dramatische Wendung, als in ihrem Gepack Diebesgut entdeckt wird. Sie wird verhaftet, und Georg muss alles daransetzen, ihre Unschuld zu beweisen. Dafur bleibt ihm nur ein Weg: Er muss sich an Fredericka Mandelbaum wenden, eine bekannte deutsche Einwanderin und Chefin der New Yorker Unterwelt. Sie hat einflussreiche Kontakte bis in die hochsten Kreise der Stadt. Georg erkennt schnell, dass New York von Korruption durchzogen ist. Um seine Verlobte aus dem Gefangnis zu befreien, muss er Entscheidungen treffen, die seine Moral auf die Probe stellen.

<title>Urwald von morgen - Nationalpark Eifel</title>
<desc>Der erste und bislang einzige Nationalpark Nordrhein-Westfalens, nur 50 Kilometer sudwestlich von Koln, ist das grune Herz des Westens. Diese Eifelregion ist Schauplatz eines wegweisenden Experiments: Auf drei Viertel der Parkflache wird der ehemalige Wirtschaftswald sich selbst uberlassen, und die Natur ubernimmt Stuck fur Stuck die Hoheit. Tote Baume werden stehen gelassen, √Ñste krachen herab und Stamme vermodern am Boden. So entsteht ein Urwald von morgen, der schon jetzt vor allem scheuen Tieren ein einzigartiges Zuhause bietet. Der Film erzahlt eine Erfolgsgeschichte des Naturschutzes inmitten einer von Menschen gepragten Umgebung. Abseits der Dorfer und √Ñcker stehen die heimlichen Ruckkehrer im Mittelpunkt. Heimlichtuer, die die Menschennahe nicht mogen oder ohne Ruckzugsorte aussterben wurden. Nun schleichen immer mehr Wildkatzen durchs Dickicht, Biber nagen ungestort an Baumen und Schwarzstorche klappern im Blatterdach.

<sub-title>Pantelleria</sub-title>
<desc>Pantelleria ist ein schlafender Vulkan, wobei der letzte Ausbruch schon weit zuruckliegt. Aber es dampft, brodelt und blubbert immer noch uberall auf der Insel. Die Insel ist Italiens nachstgelegenes Stuck Erde zu Afrika. Die hier siedelnden Araber nannten die Insel einst die "Tochter des Windes". Die Bezeichnung kommt nicht von ungefahr, fegen doch der kalte Mistral und der heiSSe Scirocco abwechselnd uber Pantelleria hinweg. Die Garten, nicht selten in Terrassen angelegt, schutzen die knapp 8.000 Bewohner mit Mauern aus Lavagestein. Viele davon hat Pietro Di Malta gebaut. Sein Vorname ist Familientradition und ganz bewusst gewahlt. Pietro bedeutet: Stein. Schon seine UrgroSSeltern nannten sich "Pirriatri", also die, die sich auf die Arbeit mit Stein spezialisiert hatten. Das eine ist sein angeborenes Talent, wie er es beschreibt, das Apnoetauchen und die Harpunenjagd sind seine Leidenschaften. Er ist vor den Klippen der Insel regelmaSSig auf der Jagd nach den typischen Mittelmeerfischen. Eine der bekanntesten Sehenswurdigkeiten von Pantelleria ist der Specchio di Venere, der "Spiegel der Venus". Dieser nach Schwefel riechende turkisfarbene Binnensee ist vor 16.000 Jahren entstanden, als ein groSSer Bereich eines Vulkans in sich zusammensturzte. An vielen Stellen quillt Schwefelwasser mit einer Temperatur von bis zu 50 Grad Celsius aus dem Grund heraus. Beliebt ist der See vor allem fur Schlammbader. Pantellerias Kusten bieten steile Klippen und vom Wind gepeitschte Natur. Nichts, was die meisten Touristen anzieht. Die, die auf die Insel kommen, wollen Geschichte und Natur pur.</desc>

<title>Europas groSSter Nationalpark in den Karpaten?</title>
<desc>In einem der letzten Urwaldgebiete Europas scheint die Zeit stehengeblieben zu sein. Baren, Luchse und Wolfsrudel durchstreifen uralte dunkle Buchenwalder. Die FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü-Berge in den rumanischen Karpaten sind ein Ort der unberuhrten Wildnis und Schutzgebiet fur viele Tierarten, die anderswo langst ausgestorben sind. Die Biologen Barbara und Christoph Promberger haben eine Vision: Sie wollen hier einen riesigen Nationalpark erschaffen, eine Art Yellowstone fur Europa. Die Umsetzung dieser Idee ist jedoch alles andere als einfach. Die Stiftung "Conservation Carpathia" hat bisher 28.000 Hektar Wald gekauft, den sie vor illegalem Holzeinschlag schutzen will, um dort weitere bedrohte Arten wie Geier oder Wisente anzusiedeln. Doch Rumanien zahlt zu den armsten Regionen Europas, viele Einheimische mussen in den eiskalten Wintern ihr Feuerholz noch immer in den Waldern schlagen. AuSSerdem wachst die Angst vor Angriffen durch Baren und Wolfe. Der Anwalt Bogdan Todoran unterstutzt Dorfbewohner, die gegen das Projekt kampfen. Nach Jahren des Kommunismus und der Enteignungen herrscht Misstrauen, da einige Rumanen befurchten, wieder ihrer Rechte beraubt zu werden. Die Stiftung der Prombergers setzt auf Dialog und konkrete praktische MaSSnahmen, um den Konflikt zu entscharfen. Naturschutz, der auch den Anwohnern zugutekommt - kann das gelingen?</desc>

<sub-title>Fur immer Dein</sub-title>
<desc>Wahrend Moritz Bruck mit seinem kleinen Sohn Theo beim Campen ist, wird seine Frau Anna in ihrer Goldschmiede oberhalb der Saar erschossen aufgefunden. Fur den erfolgreichen Unternehmer bricht die Welt zusammen. Er tut alles, um in dieser tragischen Zeit fur seinen Sohn da zu sein. Moritz arbeitet eng mit Hauptkommissarin Judith Mohn und ihrem Kollegen Freddy Breyer zusammen. Er will helfen, dass der Mord an seiner Frau schnellstmoglich aufgeklart wird. Bald gibt es erste Hinweise, dass Anna moglicherweise einen Geliebten hatte. Ist er der Morder? Bei den weiteren Ermittlungen zeigt sich, dass Moritz Firma, die eine App zur Fruherkennung von Hautkrebs entwickelt hat, von Wulf Harms, einem inzwischen verstorbenen Krebspatienten, verklagt wurde. Fur Judith und Freddy erhartet sich der Verdacht, dass sich Harms trauernder Ehemann Otto durch den Mord rachen wollte. Als Otto Harms tatsachlich wieder in der Nahe der Goldschmiede gesehen wird, gibt es kurz darauf einen perfiden Mordanschlag auf Moritz und seinen Sohn, den Judith in letzter Minute verhindern kann. AnschlieSSend fehlt von Otto Harms jede Spur und nicht einmal sein neuer Lebensgefahrte weiSS, wo er sein konnte. Durch weitere Nachforschungen finden Judith und Freddy Hinweise, dass Harms Vorwurfe gegen die von Moritz entwickelte App, die kurz vor der Markteinfuhrung steht, berechtigt gewesen sein konnten. Nicht alles lauft in Moritz Firma so rund, wie es scheint. Schon bald werden die Zweifel am mutmaSSlichen Tathergang immer groSSer und bringen Judith und Freddy auf eine ganz andere Spur ‚Ä¶</desc>

Damit einher geht ein kontinuierlicher Wettlauf zwischen den Playern der Branche in den Bereichen Technologie, Marketing - und Geopolitik. Die Herausforderungen: Unabhangigkeit, Sicherheit und die Kontrolle uber die technischen Entwicklungen. Das Smartphone-Duell zwischen den US-amerikanischen und chinesischen Tech-Giganten fangt gerade erst an. Im Zentrum der Begehrlichkeiten steht ein besonders strategischer Bereich: Halbleiter, wesentliche Bestandteile aller modernen elektronischen Devices. Die Halbleiterproduktion dominiert Taiwan, ein enger Verbundeter Washingtons, und erklartes Angriffsziel Chinas. Damit steht im 21.

<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<sub-title>Christmas - The Hebrides</sub-title>
<desc>Everyone Romesh has ever met has told him how amazing the Scottish islands are - but nobody he knows has actually ever been there. Now, in a year when travel abroad has been all but forbidden, he is heading to the Hebrides to find out if you can really have a proper adventure so close to home, spending a week visiting the isles of Skye, Harris and Lewis. Guiding him through the journey will be Donald Macsween, or Sweeney to his friends, a local crofter from the far north of Lewis - a place that lies as far north as Greenland. During their trip, Sweeney will show Romesh the spectacular rugged beauty of the islands and what at first glance look like Caribbean sandy beaches (but turn out to be utterly freezing). Rom will try his hand at the Highlands Games and try to avoid feeling up a sheeps testicles during a day spent on Sweeneys farm. Along the way, there will be a trip to the remote island of St Kilda - four hours out across the open Atlantic - and a chaotic afternoon spent with local band Peat and Diesel, the biggest thing to hit the Western Isles for decades. But it is also a trip full of surprises - Rom will find a community that is at times uncomfortable with the sheer number of people now visiting the islands and find out why its people are having to fight so hard to preserve their local culture.</desc>

<title>Deadly Disasters</title>
<sub-title>Wildfire</sub-title>
<desc>A series that looks at some of the most terrifying and destructive natural disasters that face humankind. Amazing camerawork takes the viewer into the heart of the catastrophic devastation that mother nature can throw at us. The show includes reports from survivors that personalize the trauma and experience of dealing with such calamitous ruin. Each epsiode explores a different type of disaster, from the deadly Asian tsunamis of 2004 and 2011 to hurricanes Katrina and Maria which destroyed parts of the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico to the desolation caused by volcanic eruptions such as that of Vesuvius in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii and Kilauea on the island of Hawaii. Humankind has very little control over these phenomena which can severly impact human life on the planet and change our world forever.</desc>

<desc>Ben Fogle explores and follows the same path that various individuals have walked. Having willingly forsaken the luxuries and lifestyle that the modern world has to offer, Ben Fogle explores the less-than-ordinary life that people have swapped to in the wilderness. Many of these destinations are primarily "off the grid" in some of the most remote locations on earth, including Georgia Swamplands USA, Swedish Arctic Circle, Wilderness Island Australia and the Sahara Desert. Men, either alone or with a family, sacrifice the comforts and almost any social life to experience the hardships, challenges and rewards of a life that is constantly challenged by nature and be at one with nature. Being largely dependant on their own abilities, Ben Fogle experiences their way of living for a week to understand the reasons behind why they chose this new way of living. Released on Channel 5 in the UK, Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild was produced by Motion Content Group and Renegade Pictures.</desc>

<title>Inside the Factory</title>
<sub-title>Cherry Bakewell</sub-title>
<desc>Gregg Wallace is in Stoke on Trent, at an enormous Cherry Bakewell factory where they produce 250,000 little tarts every day. He follows the production of Cherry Bakewells, from the arrival of 27 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way he learns what makes a shortcrust pastry "short" and discovers the simple way they ensure every cherry is precisely placed. They employ a team of twelve who carefully pop each one on top by hand. Meanwhile Cherry Healey is learning how to swerve a soggy pastry bottom when baking pies and tarts at home. She discovers that its all about a pre-heated oven, a proper pie dish, rolling the pastry to the correct thickness and blind baking. And shes at an almond butter factory, learning how almonds are roasted and milled to become a thick spread ready for toast. Historian Ruth Goodman is sniffing out the origins of one of the Cherry Bakewells key ingredients, frangipane. She learns that surprisingly; the familiar fragrant almond filling was born out of a perfume used to disguise the foul smells of seventeenth century Paris. She also visits the Peak District town of Bakewell and learns how the modern Cherry Bakewell is a decedent of a simple recipe mistake in the kitchen.</desc>

<title>Deadly 60</title>
<sub-title>Rhino Rescue Special</sub-title>
<desc>In this episode, Steve is in South Africa, home to a huge number of animals on the Deadly 60. However, big predators arent what Steve is here for - hes exploring the plight of the rhino. One of the planets greatest defenders in its own world, the rhino now needs our help. Sought after for their horns, these animals are on the verge of being poached to extinction. Steve travels to a rhino sanctuary to see for himself the effects of this terrible trade. He meets little Arthur the Brave, so named because when his mother was killed he stood over her and tried to protect her. He still bears the scars from where the poachers hit him when he was just three weeks old. Steve explains that rhinos need heroes to help in the fight against poachers and heads out to Kariega Reserve, where a crack anti-poaching team use the latest technology to stop poachers in their tracks. Steve goes on the run, but the anti-poaching unit track him down in a thrilling chase, with the help of Roxy the sniffer dog. He might evade the units helicopters, radios and smoke bombs but theres simply no escaping Roxys nose! After the excitement of the chase, Steve relates Thandis story. Thandi is a rhino that survived a poaching attack, and Steve watches footage of the aftermath of that attack, overcome with emotion as he describes the scene. He reveals that Thandi miraculously survived the ordeal and has gone on to have not one but three calves - the latest of which is named Mthetho. The name means "justice" and is a fitting name as the poachers responsible for Thandis attack have recently been sentenced to 25 years in prison. One of the best ways to protect rhinos is to keep a close watch on them. Steve joins South Africas number one rhino vet William Fowlds and his team as they take to the skies in a helicopter to dart a huge male rhino so that they can fit a radio collar. As he watches over the sleeping rhino, the enormity of the challenges these animals face really strikes Steve, and he makes a passionate plea that we must do all we can to save them if we want a world with rhinos.</desc>

<title>The Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan</title>
<sub-title>Romania</sub-title>
<desc>As with most Brits, the headlines that flash into Romeshs mind when he thinks about Romania are those around communism, the 90s orphan crisis, maligned Roma and its greatest celebrity export, Count Dracula. But is this image justified? Or does Romania have more to offer? Landing in Bucharest, the only place in the country hes heard of, Romesh meets political activist and media expert Angi Serban at the parliament palace, the astonishing architectural behemoth built on the command of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Failing to warn him about the miles theyre about to clock, she takes Rom out of the capital to explore many amazing things that are overlooked in this vast slice of eastern Europe. Romesh and Angi embark on a journey through the countrys seemingly endless and varied landscapes. Along the way they will sample Romanias ghoulish side, seeing Transylvania and Vlad the Impalers castle and paying their respects in a "merry" cemetery. They also witness cars rolling up hills, drive along the spectacular yet dangerous Transfagarasan Highway, dance to world-famous Roma music and take part in a spiritual ceremony in Romanias traditional heartland. But whilst Romesh realises the beauty of Romania, he also learns of how the hangover of the communist regime remains, what challenges are still faced today and why more people visiting would help the country to continue to move forward.</desc>

<desc>Dara begins his journey by revealing how the moon governs time. Returning to Ireland, near where he grew up, he goes to Newgrange ‚Äì an ancient archaeological site near the Wicklow Mountains. Its an enormous solar calendar but it is now suggested that the mysterious markings on stones around the site could make it the worlds first lunar calendars too, created by stone-age farmers to help them plan their crops. We discover how much the moon still influences life on earth. Farmer Julian Ellis plans his farming according to the phases of the moon. And we discover how much the moons immense influence on the tides also governs fisherman Sam Jones daily life. Dara next travels to the coasts of Kent to meet astrobiologist Professor Lewis Dartnell to find out just how far the moons influence on life on earth extends. Lewis explains how important the moons pull on the Earths tides has been to evolution for the animals that live in coastal areas but also on human evolution. But does the moon still affect life on earth and directly affect people, as many believe? Dara meets Dr. Rohin Francis to dig deeper into the myths surrounding the moons influence on human behavior, and to discuss some of the latest evidence. But regardless of the myths and legends ‚Äì the one way the moon undoubtably shaped our history was the race to put a human on the moon. Dara meets Dr Katie Joy who studies moon rocks brought back from the Apollo missions to find out what they discovered from them and are still discovering. Katie explains there is a new race to the moon because, incredibly, locked up in rocks across the lunar surface is believed to be vast amounts of water.</desc>

<title>Inside the Factory</title>
<sub-title>Waxed Jackets</sub-title>
<desc>Gregg Wallace is in South Shields at a clothing factory where they produce 650 waxed jackets a day. He follows the production of water-resistant jackets from the arrival of 500 metre long rolls of undyed cotton through to dispatch. Along the way he sees the fabric dipped into baths of wax heated to 95 degrees Celsius and learns how a 23 piece pattern is used to create a complex 3D jacket jigsaw. Meanwhile Cherry Healey is learning about the science of staying dry. She finds that its easy enough to waterproof a fabric by coating it in a non - permeable coating. But while this stops water getting in, it also stops sweat getting out. The key to comfortable rain resistance is a breathable membrane which contains microscopic holes, big enough to allow steam to escape, but too small to let rain drops in. Cherry also visits an umbrella factory where manufacturing methods have barely changed in 150 years. She helps transform a simple wooden stick into a top-notch canopy using saws, pliers and needle and thread. Historian Ruth Goodman is investigating the fishy origin of waxed jackets. She visits a remote Scottish harbour and learns how these weatherproof coats were born out of oil covered sail cloth which seamen adapted into garments to keep out the worst of the weather. She also visits Edinburgh and learns how an English King played a key role in the popularity of that favourite Scottish fabric, tartan.</desc>

<sub-title>Extremes</sub-title>
<desc>David Attenborough reveals the extraordinary ways in which animals battle to survive the elements in a world of extremes - places where life exists on a knife edge. From mountain summits to scorching deserts, polar tundra to deep underground caves, these remote places are rarely visited, yet the animals that survive there are some of the most resilient and specially adapted on Earth. In Vietnam, the true scale and grandeur of whats thought to be the worlds largest cave - Hang Son Doong - is revealed. In its depths, blind, white cave fish are found in tiny pools of water, surviving on nutrients washed in from the jungle above. On Ellesmere Island, a pack of Arctic wolves fight to rebuild their strength after one of the toughest winters on earth. But the season of plenty is not all it seems - with prey so scarce they must travel vast distances to find it. And when they do, they must battle their ancient foes - musk ox, a relic of the Ice Age. The wolves success during the short Arctic summer could mean the difference between life and death. Emerging after months below the ice, a European common frog sticks his head out of the snow. Its a sunny Spring Day in the Alps - the perfect day to find a mate. But hes not the only one - dozens of other frogs are all making their way to the breeding pool. Its a race to get there before the other males. Will he get there in time? Huddling can be a survival superpower, especially in the winter cold of the Atlas Mountains. For a young Barbary macaque, separated from the group, its vital to find and re-join the huddle before nightfall... but there is a surprising obstacle in his way. Possibly the ultimate huddle is found in the mountains of Mexico, where millions of monarch butterflies are overwintering. But the calm is shattered when a storm hits their forest shelter. Fires are one of natures most destructive forces, but they are also vital for keeping some habitats healthy - few places more so than northern Australias savannahs. A pair of golden-shouldered parrots are raising their family inside a termite mound! Thick walls keep the chicks safe from predators, but when a fire unexpectedly strikes, will the nest protect them? As the climate changes, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and often more intense. On the plains of Kenya, an elephant matriarch is struggling to keep her two sons alive. After months of drought and with food and water supplies critically low, the family are faced with tragedy. Few places are more extreme than the Gobi Desert - temperatures here can range up to 40 degrees Celsius. But one iconic animal of the extremes has made its home here: the snow leopard. This rare and intimate view of a mother and cubs reminds us that the extremes still hold some of planet earths greatest secrets and most spectacular natural wonders.</desc>

Surviving in this merciless land is a test of mental strength as much as it is physical, as the inhabitants must endure crippling isolation and the constant work required, where one wrong decision could cost you your life.</desc>

<desc>A pair of celebrities prepare to tackle some of the worlds most dangerous roads in this documentary series fraught with danger, delight and, with several comedians taking on the challenge, plenty of humour. Each episode sees a different pair of famous faces team up and traverse a hazardous route across difficult terrain. These potentially deadly routes dissect dramatic mountain ranges, sweltering jungles, desolate deserts and icy highways, encompassing some our planets most spectacular landscapes. Duos have included Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes, as they navigate their way through Georgia, Marcus Brigstoke and Phil Jupitus, broadening their horizons of Bolivia, and Rhod Gilbert and Greg Davies, who weave through the stunning Himalayas.</desc>

<sub-title>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</sub-title>
<desc>Alexander Armstrong heads for the Paradise Isle of the Indian Ocean Sri Lanka, discovering not only the golden sands but also its historic culture. From the gorgeous Sinhalese areas in the central and southern regions to the less-travelled Tamil north. Now a destination for everything from the most modern urban sophistication to laid-back surf cafes, Sri Lanka has started to recover from a long civil war and incredible natural disasters to welcome the sort of visitors - the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese - who used to be the colonial powers here. Along the way he meets some unforgettable characters - human, elephant‚Ä¶ and even the odd reptile. Straight off the bat Alexander is sent on a mystery mission to learn "how to make his trip to Sr Lanka ten times better". This involves a tuk tuk ride to meet a mysterious guru called Shanjei. Alexander is seduced by the golden beaches of the south west, and his first port of call is the fortress town of Galle built first by the Portuguese in 1588. Alexander encounters Asanka who earns his living by diving 30ft headlong off the walls into just 6 feet of water. Alexanders love of classical music leads him to investigate the life of a Choon Pan Man. In converted tuk tuks these men deliver freshly-baked bread to Sri Lankans, accompanied by the distinctive notes of a well-known Beethoven piece. At a nearby Buddhist temple Alexander meets his first elephant which is sadly chained up outside. This spurs him on to find out more about captive elephants in Sri Lanka and at the Elephant Millennium foundation he meets Sudimenika, one of eight majestic elephants that have been rescued. He also gets involved in the making of elephant poo paper at the factory next door. Sri Lanka has an estimated three million stray dogs and, at what is possibly the worlds largest dog home, Alexander meets its founder Kim Cooling from Essex and a few of the rescued strays. He then joins them for a trip to the beach where some of the handicapped dogs are introduced to chaotic seaborne hydrotherapy. Alexander has four boys and visits a mask making factory in search of presents. The masks are quickly deemed too scary, and events change direction when Alexander is prescribed an exorcism that turns into a spectacular fire-born ritual. Sri Lanka is home to the new global phenomenon of the Digital Guru, highflyers working from anywhere on their laptops, and surfing at 6.30am. Alexander joins in the new trend and surfs the rolling waves.</desc>

<sub-title>Extremes</sub-title>
<desc>David Attenborough reveals the extraordinary ways in which animals battle to survive the elements in a world of extremes - places where life exists on a knife edge. From mountain summits to scorching deserts, polar tundra to deep underground caves, these remote places are rarely visited, yet the animals that survive there are some of the most resilient and specially adapted on Earth. In Vietnam, the true scale and grandeur of whats thought to be the worlds largest cave - Hang Son Doong - is revealed. In its depths, blind, white cave fish are found in tiny pools of water, surviving on nutrients washed in from the jungle above. On Ellesmere Island, a pack of Arctic wolves fight to rebuild their strength after one of the toughest winters on earth. But the season of plenty is not all it seems - with prey so scarce they must travel vast distances to find it. And when they do, they must battle their ancient foes - musk ox, a relic of the Ice Age. The wolves success during the short Arctic summer could mean the difference between life and death. Emerging after months below the ice, a European common frog sticks his head out of the snow. Its a sunny Spring Day in the Alps - the perfect day to find a mate. But hes not the only one - dozens of other frogs are all making their way to the breeding pool. Its a race to get there before the other males. Will he get there in time? Huddling can be a survival superpower, especially in the winter cold of the Atlas Mountains.

<desc>The orange blob is down at the Museum, nerding out about ancient Egypt, when the Docs show up and ruin Lamputs day. Darn science geeks. No respect for culture. A superior knowledge of history keeps Lamput one step ahead of the blue boffins - how many times can two chemists get kicked out of the same Museum? The Docs sneak back into the exhibition disguised as mummies. They learn the hard way that a disguise can be TOO good; they get locked into a glass box overnight. Lucky break, though; this is the night when a renowned jewel thief tries to steal the museums precious treasures. Lamput and the Docs get tangled up in the heist. The rest is history.</desc>

<title>Prokofiev - Cello Sonata, Op. 119</title>
<desc>Aleksandr Khramouchin (cello) and Eliane Reyes (piano) perform Sergei Prokofievs Cello Sonata, Op. 119. Prokofiev was so impressed by young cellist Mstislav Rostropovichs performance of a sonata written by the composers long-time friend Nikolai Miaskovsky, Prokofiev was determined to compose a cello sonata of his own for Rostropovich. The result was Prokofievs Cello Sonata, Op. 119 (1949), which saw its premiere at the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory in 1950, with Rostropovich as the soloist. Prokofievs musical partnership with Rostropovich influenced some of his other cello works as well. His Symphony-Concerto in E minor for cello and orchestra, Op. 125 (1950-1952) is another product of this collaboration between composer and cellist. The current performance was recorded as part of the Musicorum Festival at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels, Belgium, 2021.</desc>

<title>Mariken in the Garden of Earthly Delights</title>
<desc>The opera "Mariken in the Garden of Earthly Delights," to music by Calliope Tsoupaki, is based on the miracle play "Mariken van Nieumeghen" (c. 1515). Over five centuries, this old story hasnt lost a bit of its power and is unquestionably part of the canon of Dutch culture. In this opera, we follow the curious but vulnerable Mariken on a journey through a dark world. She encounters intriguing characters, such as a witchlike aunt, a seductive devil, and an inquisitorial pope. The ASKO|Schonberg and the Tetraktys Ensemble are under the musical direction of Hern√°n Schvartzman. Main soloists are Hannah Hoekstra (Mariken), Harry van der Kamp (Uncle), Jill Feldman (Aunt), Julian Podger (Moenen), and Michael Chance (Pope). Staged by Serge van Veggel, and directed by Sonia Herman Dolz. Recorded at the Royal Theater in The Hague, in 2015.</desc>

Soloists are Ibolya Verebics, Andrea Rost, Uwe Heilmann and Daniel Lichti. After Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had married Constanze Weber on the 4th of August 1782, he promised to compose a mass in her honour. He intended for the mass to be performed during the newlyweds visit to Mozarts father in Salzburg. In January 1783 Mozart wrote to his father that his Mass in C minor "Grosse Messe" was halfway finished, but when he arrived in Salzburg in July of the same year the mass was still incomplete. He would never finish the mass.The parts of the mass that Mozart did manage to compose (the Kyrie and Gloria) had their opening on the 26th of October 1783 in Salzburg, with Constanze as solo soprano.</desc>

<title>The Violins Voice</title>
<desc>How can we describe the intimate connection between an instrument and its player? World renowned violinist Frank Peter Zimmerman refers to his 1711 Stradivarius "Lady Inchiquin" as the "love of his life," but what does it take for a piece of wood to achieve such reverential status? After having to return his beloved instrument, which was owned by West LB, Zimmerman turned to Martin Schleske, a violin maker considered by many to be a "21st Century Stradivari." This documentary intertwines Zimmermans tale of separation and reunion with behind the scenes demonstrations of Schleskes work, charting the life of the violin from workshop to concert hall.</desc>

The conductorless ensemble consists of musicians from the most prestigious European orchestras, international soloists, and young talents. In this performance, Les Dissonances play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Serenade No. 10 for winds in B-flat major, K. 361, also known as the Gran Partita. The composition is written for twelve winds and double bass and consists of seven parts. The pieces duration is longer than the composers other chamber music works. Remarkably, Mozart chose to use a larger instrumentation. To the eight instruments of the common wind octet, Mozart added two basset horns, two additional horns, and a double bass. This performance was recorded at Philharmonie de Paris, France, in 2015.</desc>

<title>Liszt - Due Poemi Sinfonici</title>
<desc>Franz Liszt (1811 - 1886) composed 13 symphonic poems, largely inspired by literary texts. The composer himself wrote piano duet arrangements for these pieces, showcasing his incredible ability of imitating a full orchestra on the piano. Liszt, one of the 19th centurys most important piano virtuosos, strongly influenced the further development of piano music. The Romantic period was the era of the virtuoso pianists: the piano was the instrument of choice for countless musicians and listeners alike. No house of standing could do without a piano: it was a status symbol. Piano music was played in concert halls, palaces, salons, churches and public houses alike. Liszts symphonic poem no. 4, Orpheus, breathes a meditative atmosphere. No. 3, Les Preludes, is best known in its symphonic version - the piano version presented here is rarely heard. The work dates back to the period 1848 - 1854 and was initially meant to serve as introduction to a choral cycle to be based on the texts of the poet Joseph Autran, Les quatre elements: earth, air, water and fire. In this broadcast, the Italian piano duo of Marco Sollini and Salvatore Barbatano performs these Liszt piano works. These recordings were made at the beautiful 12th century church of San Marco in the small but picturesque village of Ponzano di Fermo, as part of the 2015 edition of the annual, itinerant festival "Armonie della sera" in the Italian province of Le Marche.</desc>

<title>Schumann - Fantasiestucke, Op. 12</title>
<desc>After recording all 32 Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas to celebrate the composers 250th birth anniversary, celebrated Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz decided to record solo piano works by Robert Schumann. In this performance, Schwarz presents Schumanns Fantasiestucke, Op. 12. Written in 1837, the work is a set of eight piano pieces with contrasting moods. The works title is derived from one of the composers favourite authors collection of novellas: E. T. A. Hoffmanns Fantasiestucke in Callots Manier. Like Schumanns Davidsbundlertanze, his Fantasiestucke are designed as a musical dialogue between Florestan and Eusebius, representing the duality of his own personality. The former represents the composers passionate side, and the latter depicts the dreamer in Schumann. Acclaimed pianist Riccardo Schwartz (1986) has performed as a soloist with many world-renowned conductors, including Gustav Kuhn and Yuri Temirkanov.

<desc>In May 2019, the new principal conductor of the Gewandhaus, Andris Nelsons, presented Tchaikovskys Symphony No. 5 with his orchestra in combination with Shostakovichs Violin Concerto No. 1 with outstanding violinist Baiba Skride as the soloist. In this composition, the violin does not allow itself a break, continually tells its dark story and gets into a vicious circle of ostinato Passacaglia bass lines again and again falls into beguilingly beautiful singing. Tchaikovsky initially thought his "Symphony of Fate" was a failure and believed himself to be at the end of his creative powers. It was probably the composers nature, plagued by self-doubt, that made it almost impossible for him to develop a self-confident attitude to his own creative power. Between this two works, Skride performs Stravinskys Elegy for Solo Violin.</desc>

The six crews have to weigh up the consequences in these old and hazardous mines, often risking their lives in search of opal wealth, not to mention preventing opportunistic thieves from snatching their hauls.</desc>

<desc>To say expert British mechanic Ant Anstead is a lover of cars would be an understatement. The term petrol head does not quite cover the passion he exudes for motor vehicles.

We follow Ant and his Alfa on their journey from workshop to race circuit, as he overcomes challenges, setbacks and deadlines to get this commemorative racer ready in time.</desc>

<sub-title>Its Alive</sub-title>
<desc>To say expert British mechanic Ant Anstead is a lover of cars would be an understatement. The term petrol head does not quite cover the passion he exudes for motor vehicles. One of the vehicles that Ant has a particular obsession with is the 1930s Alfa Romeo 158 Grand Prix race car, one of the greatest racers ever made, which he is honouring in this documentary series by building his own from scratch. We follow Ant and his Alfa on their journey from workshop to race circuit, as he overcomes challenges, setbacks and deadlines to get this commemorative racer ready in time.</desc>

<title>Into the Jungle with Ed Stafford</title>
<desc>International explorer Ed Stafford leads six ordinary dads and their kids on an extreme adventure designed to bring them closer. Deep in the jungles of Belize where his own love of adventure began, Ed tests the group in a series of challenges before sending them off into the jungle to fend for themselves. This time the dads and kids must forage for their evening meal, but the idea of eating live jungle critters - including spiders - proves too much for some. The next day, Ed promises the group a slap-up meal... if they can catch and kill it themselves. Heading out to one of Belizes 200 island cays, the dads and kids must build rafts strong enough to take them out to sea to dive for lobsters. But as a storm brews, events take a dramatic turn.

<title>Kurt Rosenwinkel meets Peter Beets Trio</title>
<desc>The Dutch world-class jazz pianist Peter Beets has shared the stage with jazz greats like Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, "Toots" Thielemans, Elvin Jones, George Coleman, Johnny Griffin, Benny Golson and John Clayton. From birth, Beets was surrounded by music: he heard classical music from his mother, who is a music pedagogue, and he heard jazz from his father, who has a great fan of Oscar Peterson and Art Blakey. Although Beets parents originally did not associate the word "musician" with the word "career", music is definitely in the familys blood. At this concert at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, Peter Beets teams up with the world-famous guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. With a career spanning almost twenty-five years and including collaborating with dynamic peers like Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter, as well as esteemed jazz legends like Joe Henderson, Paul Motian and Gary Burton, Rosenwinkels indelible mark in music is the consummation of being steeped in the rich and deep traditions of jazz, springing off of the shoulders of such vital underpinnings to elevate his own art to new heights, evolving the language in a way no other guitarist has since his arrival. This collaboration between Beets and Rosenwinkel guarantees brilliant music.</desc>

<title>Coleman Hawkins live in Belgium, 1962</title>
<desc>A jazz festival named after the inventor of the instrument most associated with the genre, Adolphe Sax, would be incomplete without the man who laid the groundwork for how the instrument is played today. This must have been the reasoning of the organizers of the Festival International de Jazz Adolphe Sax in Dinant, Belgium, when they invited tenor saxophone giant Coleman Hawkins to perform there in June 1962. Appearing with a group that includes the French pianist George Arvanitas, one-time Duke Ellington bassist Jimmy Woode, and expat drummer Kansas Fields, the musician also known as "Bean" and "Hawk" serves up an hour-long set of familiar standards bookended by Hank Jones "Chant" and J.

<sub-title>Artvark Saxophone Quartet and Ntjam Rosie: Homelands</sub-title>
<desc>Homelands is a collaboration between Artvark Saxophone Quartet and Cameroonian-Dutch singer Ntjam Rosie. The music is inspired by both traditional and modern music from Ntjams home country Cameroon, (Manu Dibango and Richard Bona) as well as by an Afro-European blend of soul, jazz, gospel and world music. Using unorthodox sounds as the basis of their compositions, Artvark continues to be radical, experimenting with alternative ways of playing the sax. For this project, they explore the world of electronics and effects to create new sounds. Ntjams role is divers. She is the quartets fifth instrument, recites spoken word, plays (vocal) percussion, forms duos or trios with the saxophones and accompanies the quartet on her guitar. She performs texts in English as well as in French, one of Cameroons official languages, and sings in Bulu, her mother tongue.</desc>

Sixty of her hits made it into the American charts and sold over 100 million albums worldwide.

<desc>Put five distinctive characters in a band bus, let them tour Europe and beyond, and let yourself be surprised by what happens along the way! "What Could Possibly Go Wrong?", the title of Tristans 2021 album, aptly reflects the bands perspective on love and life. The Dutch, five-piece bands music is best described as feel-good vintage acid jazz, with energy, vibe, and sounds of today thrown in. Whats more, its performed by some of Europes best contemporary pop/jazz musicians. With funky rhythm guitars, Hammond organ, Fender Rhodes and synths, and a rhythm section that has been a tight-knit unit for decades, the band plays their trademark solid grooves and tight, punchy arrangements. All this underpins singer Jaycilees stunningly beautiful and soulful vocals. Tristan takes you back to the warm sound of the 1970s, adding a refreshing breeze of present influences. Tristan consists of Jaycilee Teterissa (vocals), Coen Molenaar (keys), Frans Vollink (electric bass), Sebastiaan Cornelissen (drums), and Guy Nikkels (guitar).</desc>

<sub-title>John Coltrane: Live in Comblain-la-Tour</sub-title>
<desc>The mere mention of the name John Coltrane evokes a deeply emotional, often spiritual response from even the most casual jazz fan. Dexter Gordon was a fantastic saxophonist. Miles Davis was a genius. Coltrane stood above - he was a visionary, a saint-like figure. By the standards of most jazz musicians, his life was uneventful. Sure, he had a heroin habit for a while, and Miles Davis punched him, but once hed experienced the "spiritual awakening" described in the liner notes of his 1965 album A Love Supreme, he dedicated himself to his music with extreme single-mindedness. This broadcast of Coltranes 1965 performance at the short-lived Belgian jazz festival in Comblain-la-Tour features Tranes classic quartet with Elvin Jones (drums), Jimmy Garrison (bass) and McCoy Tyner (piano).</desc>

<title>Seine Sessions</title>
<sub-title>Free and Afro Jazz</sub-title>
<desc>The term "jam-session" was born in the 1920s, when black and white musicians gathered in smoke-filled bars after their respective concerts to enjoy the kind of jazz they could not play in traditional sets. Bing Crosby was a regular at these sessions, and had fun marking the first and third beats of musical phrases by clapping hands, which the musicians call "jammin the beat". Today, the Seine Sessions revive the happy years of "jam sessions", while the cream of jazz, blues, gipsy and funk Parisian scenes occurs on the boards of the legendary restaurant and jazz club Le Reservoir. Entitled "Free and Afro Jazz," this episode hosted by Eddy King features unique performances by artists playing together for the first time, and interviews with Fantazio, Eddy Lopez, Banoit Savard, and many others.</desc>

<sub-title>Jacques Loussier in Leipzig: Play Bach and More</sub-title>
<desc>In 1959, Jacques Loussier hit upon the idea that was to make his international reputation, by combining his interest in jazz with his love of J.S. Bach. Only a pianist with such an exceptional classical technique and deft improvisatory skill could have nurtured such a vision. He founded the Play Bach Trio, which used Bachs compositions as the basis for jazz improvisation. The trio immediately caught the public imagination. In their live appearances, tours and concerts, plus a succession of recordings built on the cornerstone of four albums made between 1960 and 1963, Loussiers group achieved the breakthrough to popular commercial success enjoyed by only a select few jazz musicians. In fifteen years, the trio sold over six million albums! On July 28th 2004, the day of Bachs 254th anniversary of death, the Jacques Loussier Trio perform a special concert at the famous St. Thomas Church of Leipzig - the city where Bach composed many of his most famous works.</desc>

<desc>The MotorMusic Studios in Mechelen, Belgium, attract many great musicians to the city. A wide variety of visiting international jazz musicians share their art of making jazz music with us in the DJAZZ series Belgium Sessions. In these sessions, some of Europes finest musicians perform their own, original music. New York is Jazz Heaven: small wonder that many young Belgian musicians cross the ocean to try their musical luck in the Big Apple. One of these journeymen brings the fruits of his successful New York experiences to this MotorMusic Session: tenor saxophone player Steven Delannoye and his New York Trio join forces with saxophonist Frank Vaganee. The intense and intriguing dialogue between the two saxophones recalls the golden jazz age of the 1950s, but adds a freshness of approach that is defined by their respective experiences. The horns are underpinned by the powerful NYC-based rhythm section of drummer Jesse Simpson and bassist Desmond White, who contribute a vibrant energy that propels the saxophonists to lofty heights.</desc>

<title>Eesti teatri laulud</title>
<desc>"Eesti teatri laulud" sukeldub muusikasse, mis on kirjutatud omamaiste heliloojate poolt just lavalaudadelt k√µlamiseks. Esimene muusikaline ullatus on tolmune - aastast 1870. √úlejaanud palad pakuvad lisaavastusi, sest hulk laule on labi aegade olnud hitid ja raadiojaamade lemmikud, kuid nende loojad ja paritolu on m√µistatus. Trupp lubab, et muusikaline ekskursioon labi teatriloo on hariv ja tais ullatusi. "Eesti teatri lauludes" v√µib kuulda eesti heliloojate nii tuntud kui tundmatuid laule paljudest meie teatrites mangitud lavastustest. Eesti Kirjandusmuuseumis ja Teatri- ja Muusikamuuseumis materjale otsides avastas Riina Roose naiteks kaks intrigeerivat teksti, mis teatriajaloost meile tundmata - Lydia Koidula vembuka kuplee ja Paul Pinna opereti "Jaani oo". Noorte naitlejate jaoks oli ullatus ka see, et "P√µhjamaa" on tegelikult laul √úlo Vinteri muusikalist "Pipi Pikksukk" ja, et Arvo Part on noores eas kirjutanud muusikat lastetukkidele. Lavastuse sunnile on kaasa aidanud "elav leksikon" Valter Ojakaar. Muusikaline kujundaja: Riina Roose. Mangivad: Hele K√µre, Evelin Pang, Argo Aadli, Andero Ermel, Mart Toome, Indrek Ojari, Riina Roose, Jaak Jurisson, Indrek Tiisel. . Re≈æissoorid Gerda Kordemets ja Margiti Ossipova.</desc>

Torajad elavad saare keskel magedes ja nad on tuntud oma ebatavalise esivanemate kummardamise poolest, mis kulmineerub mitmeid paevi kestva matusetseremoonia, puhvlite ohverdamise ja tantsudega.

L√µuna-Korea tippudest on olnud heas hoos Kim Chae-yeon, kes v√µitis veebruaris Soulis nelja kontinendi meistriv√µistlustel kulla. Lisaks Jaapanile ja L√µuna-Koreale saab kolm naist valja panna ka USA, keda esindavad oma kodujaal tugevad Amber Glenn, Bradie Tennell, Isabeau Levito. MM-il on eriline kaal, sest tulemuste p√µhjal jagatakse valja ka suurem osa 2026. aasta Milano olumpiamangude kohtadest.

BroZone lagunes siis, kui Haru oli alles trollitita, habras oksake, ning sellest ajast pole ta teisi enam nainud. Kui aga uks vendadest, Floyd, kahe kuulsusejanus, aga t√µsise talendipuudega superstaarihakatise poolt roovitakse, asuvad Haru ja Popi ohtlikule ja emotsionaalsele teekonnale, et vennad taas kokku tuua. Sest vaid nii saaks nad paasta uhe omade seast saatusest, mis veel hullem kui kuulsuse kadumine!</desc>

<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons.

<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons.

<sub-title>Lillys Tiny Circus Home</sub-title>
<desc>Documentary series showing the journey of people in America who are joining the tiny-house movement, where people are actively choosing to live in smaller houses. We follow the construction process of houses that are often less than 500 square feet. We see the challenges the builders face when constructing a small home and ingenuous space-saving ideas they come up with to make the most of the limited floorspace. This show meets single people, couples and families who explain how they reached this decision to downsize to a mini-home, or why they have picked a small house as their first home. For some this is a financial decision, trying to avoid the large cost of living that comes with a standard house. Others are doing this for ecological reasons.

<title>God Bless Ozzy Osbourne</title>
<desc>Ozzy Osbourne is one of the most iconic figures in rock and one of the founding fathers of heavy metal. ""God Bless Ozzy Osbourne"" tells for the first time the story of his career from the founding of Black Sabbath through to solo stardom and his wider fame beyond. These were the wild days of his prodigious drug and alcohol intake, of biting the head from a dove at a record company meeting and biting into a bat on stage but also of the tragic death of Randy Rhoads and the reality TV show The Osbournes. The film follows Ozzys torturous and emotionally fraught journey from excess to sobriety, which Ozzy regards as his greatest accomplishment. Featuring never before seen footage, new interviews with Ozzy himself, his family, his bandmates, and those who both inspired him and were inspired by him, this is the first film to take viewers inside the mind and psyche of this legendary figure.</desc>

So were sure they were quite pleased to travel halfway around the world to the California desert to perform for Coachellas music-hungry crowds. Prior to taking to the stage in Indio, however, Foals made a pit stop at our little poolside bungalow to perform a Festival Fever Session featuring songs off their highly-acclaimed, recent full-length Holy Fire.

<title>Kulmutatud karpkala</title>
<desc>Jelena Mihhailovna on tootanud provintsilinna ainsas koolis ja elab tagasihoidlikku pensionarielu. √Ñkitselt saab ta teada surmavast diagnoosist, mis v√µib ta elu mis tahes hetkel l√µpetada. Saatuse eitamise asemel hakkab ta tegema ettevalmistusi enda surmaks, et kogu seda asja oma poja jaoks kergemaks teha. Ta pole oma ainsat poega nainud ule viie aasta, sest too tootab pealinnas. Olegil on kogu aeg tegemist ja tal pole aega oma uksiku ema jaoks. Samal ajal koos k√µigi probleemidega saab kangelanna kingituseks hiiglasliku karpkala, mis muudab tema elu.</desc>

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Officially Official</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<title>Teen Mom 2</title>
<sub-title>Natural Mother</sub-title>
<desc>Jade, Kailyn, Leah, Briana and Chelsea navigate parenting, family dynamics, careers and love lives. Through their highs and lows theyve learned that motherhood is doing whats best for their kids, which comes at no easy cost. Over the last few seasons, the Teen Moms have been tested over and over again, by baby daddy drama and struggles with family members. But, theyve put on brave faces and absorbed the pressure, trying to be strong and set the best examples for their kids. This cycle, the pent-up stress from years of dealing with deadbeat dads, unstable parents, and lying exes has reached its max and needs release. This burst of energy (and emotions) - now in the form of tense confrontations, public arguments and anxiety attacks - threatens the progress the women have made in recent years. On top of it all, the moms must face difficult decisions when the spread of COVID- 19 threatens the health and safety of their families. Will the explosive drama leave permanent relationship scars, or will the Moms avoid burns and push forward to their next chapters free and clear?</desc>

<desc>How do young people whove embraced the digital age find love? Often by connecting online with others theyve never met in person before. These days, typing on iPhones has replaced the dinner date, while emailing through Facebook often substitutes for face-to-face conversations. The problem - that cute guy you may be falling in love with could be lying about who he really is. Now, from the producers of the hit feature documentary, Catfish, comes a new MTV series that brings together couples whove interacted solely through LCD screens. Over the course of months theyve supposedly fallen in love -- but what will happen when they meet in real life for the first time? With the guidance and help of Nev Schulman, the star of the original Catfish, in each episode, a hopeful romantic partner will go on an emotional trip to discover the truth about their significant other. Is he who he says he is? And if so, will love truly blossom?</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia. Tutti elementi che ritroveremo nelloriginalissimo studio di "√à sempre mezzogiorno!", ispirato al mondo delle fiabe e immerso simbolicamente nel bosco della Val Borbera. Ad affiancare la Clerici nella conduzione, un cast fisso che √® la metafora della saggezza popolare: due nonnine e una zia pronte al commento, alla sferzata e a sporcarsi le mani tra i fornelli, limprobabile factotum Alfio insieme al Maestro Panificatore Fulvio Marino. Unallegra compagnia di giro che accompagner√† gli spettatori verso il pranzo, cucinando gomito a gomito con loro, incuriosendo con piccoli tutorial e aneddoti, tastando il polso ad unItalia che si ritrova sempre pi√π bisognosa di leggerezza e gentilezza. Latmosfera √® casalinga ed accogliente: si ride, si commentano i fatti del giorno, si fa del sano gossip, si impara qualcosa, si interagisce con il pubblico da casa e intanto si cucina. Ogni giorno ad aiutare Antonella in cucina ci saranno due cuochi, uno avvezzo alla tv e uno esordiente. Oltre alla cucina e allattualit√†, laltra colonna del programma sono i giochi telefonici con cui gli spettatori possono vincere, di volta in volta, un premio in denaro o un prodotto. Un implicito omaggio alla tv degli anni 80 rivisitato in chiave contemporanea. Durante la settimana ci saranno degli appuntamenti fissi: la fatina dei dolci, il maestro pasticcere pronto a dispensare consigli e tecniche raffinate, lesperto di territorio e di vino, e Angela Frenda, che con la sua rubrica "Ricette damore" racconter√† storie e aneddoti di personaggi famosi. Il tutto mentre sui fuochi bolle il sugo, qualcuno offre una fetta di salame o un caff√®. Proprio come a casa.</desc>

<title>√à sempre mezzogiorno</title>
<desc>Antonella Clerici torna in tv con un format originale nato dalla contaminazione tra talk e cooking show. Negli ultimi anni Antonella Clerici √® stata protagonista di un grande cambiamento di vita: nella sua tenuta in campagna ha sperimentato concretamente la piacevolezza del vivere a contatto con la natura. E cos√¨ ha deciso di accogliere il pubblico nel suo nuovo mondo fatto di autenticit√† e genuinit√†, amore per la campagna, per il territorio italiano e i suoi prodotti, per la provincia. Tutti elementi che ritroveremo nelloriginalissimo studio di "√à sempre mezzogiorno!", ispirato al mondo delle fiabe e immerso simbolicamente nel bosco della Val Borbera. Ad affiancare la Clerici nella conduzione, un cast fisso che √® la metafora della saggezza popolare: due nonnine e una zia pronte al commento, alla sferzata e a sporcarsi le mani tra i fornelli, limprobabile factotum Alfio insieme al Maestro Panificatore Fulvio Marino. Unallegra compagnia di giro che accompagner√† gli spettatori verso il pranzo, cucinando gomito a gomito con loro, incuriosendo con piccoli tutorial e aneddoti, tastando il polso ad unItalia che si ritrova sempre pi√π bisognosa di leggerezza e gentilezza. Latmosfera √® casalinga ed accogliente: si ride, si commentano i fatti del giorno, si fa del sano gossip, si impara qualcosa, si interagisce con il pubblico da casa e intanto si cucina. Ogni giorno ad aiutare Antonella in cucina ci saranno due cuochi, uno avvezzo alla tv e uno esordiente. Oltre alla cucina e allattualit√†, laltra colonna del programma sono i giochi telefonici con cui gli spettatori possono vincere, di volta in volta, un premio in denaro o un prodotto. Un implicito omaggio alla tv degli anni 80 rivisitato in chiave contemporanea. Durante la settimana ci saranno degli appuntamenti fissi: la fatina dei dolci, il maestro pasticcere pronto a dispensare consigli e tecniche raffinate, lesperto di territorio e di vino, e Angela Frenda, che con la sua rubrica "Ricette damore" racconter√† storie e aneddoti di personaggi famosi. Il tutto mentre sui fuochi bolle il sugo, qualcuno offre una fetta di salame o un caff√®. Proprio come a casa.</desc>

<title>Mario Barth deckt auf!</title>
<desc>Mario Barth: "Sanierung Kolner Buhnen": Die Sanierung der Kolner Oper ist ein reines Trauerspiel und eines der bislang teuersten Kulturprojekte in Deutschland. Die Gesamtkosten der Sanierung, inklusive Zinsen und Kosten fur Ausweichquartiere, belaufen sich derzeit auf uber 1,2 Milliarden Euro. Im Mai 2024 wurde die Eroffnung erneut verschoben - diesmal ohne Nennung eines neuen Termins. Diese Verzogerung verursacht weitere Kosten, da Oper und Schauspiel langer in den teuren Ausweichquartieren bleiben mussen, deren Mieten die Stadt Koln tragt. Absurd: "Die Hulle ist zu klein": Der Wunsch, die modernste Technik, die viel Platz benotigt, in ein Gebaude aus den 60er Jahren einzubauen, war unrealistisch. Inkompetenter Bauherr: Die Sanierung wurde von drei Intendanten geleitet, die keine Erfahrung mit komplexen BaumaSSnahmen hatten.</desc>

Men hur fortsatter denna klassiker att forma v√•r samtid?

<desc>Juri saab kopsaka ettemaksu, et kirjutada mahukas teaduslik raamat, aga ta ei saa linnakorteris keskenduda, naaber puurib, tuvid karjuvad, autod vurisevad. Linnapapad-mammad otsustavad siis maale rahu ja vaikust otsima minna, et Juri saaks raamatu √µigeaegselt valmis. Samas on lahenemas m√µlema mamma juubel ja see tekitab koheselt teravat konkurentsi: kumb mamma on ikka nooruslikum ja kummal tuleb agedam juubelifestival. Volli on kade, et Jurit kui kirjanikku liigselt poputatakse ja ta uritab Mitskini abiga sulemeest narrida. Mitskin saab aga r√µ√µmustava teate: talle sundis lapselaps ja seltskonda lisandub uus ja uhke papa!</desc>

<title>Quand les bourgeois font leur cinema</title>
<desc>Le cinema fran√ßais est-il devenu au fil du temps un cinema petit bourgeois ? Pourtant √† ses debuts, il fut considere comme lart du peuple car il contenait dans sa nature meme la force dun explosif en faveur des revanches sociales. Que sest il donc passe ? A partir de lapr√®s-guerre, les differences entre les classes bourgeoises et proletaires samenuisent progressivement. Est-ce parce que bourgeois et proletaires regardent les memes programmes de television et se croisent dans les memes lieux de villegiature que le cinema a fini par sinstaller dans un conformisme qui a efface les differences sociales ? Tous semblables ? Certainement pas ! Un certain nombre de cineastes continuent de marquer la difference entre le monde bourgeois et le monde ouvrier.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne.

<title>Chroniques den haut</title>
<desc>En gravissant le mont Blanc par un jour de grand vent et de froid intense en septembre 2001, pour etablir la mesure la plus precise jamais realisee de laltitude de ce sommet mythique, les geom√®tres-experts de Haute-Savoie se sont inscrits dans une tr√®s longue histoire. Portant sur leur dos les instruments de leur temps, ceux du XXIe si√®cle, ils nont fait que mettre leurs pas dans ceux des hommes des XVIIIe, XIXe et XXe si√®cles qui les avaient precedes sur cette montagne, avec le meme desir et la meme exigence dexactitude. Les geom√®tres-experts et leurs partenaires se donnent desormais rendez-vous tous les deux ans √† Chamonix ou Saint-Gervais pour relever un defi technique et sportif √† chaque fois renouvele : lascension du toit de lEurope, deux jours de?orts et dalpinisme, pour aller mesurer avec precision son altitude, mais aussi le volume et la morphologie de sa calotte sommitale.En renouvelant √† periode reguli√®re ce travail dexpert, les geom√®tres alpins realisent ainsi une demarche scienti?que √† la portee particuli√®rement originale : car la somme des informations quils accumulent avec le temps est avant tout un l√®gue pour les generations futures. Cest cette aventure singuli√®re que le film se propose daccompagner. Il sagit dabord dune aventure de montagne exceptionnelle, il faut reussir √† monter, √† dos dhomme et sans aucune assistance mecanique, le materiel de mesure. En soi le pari est chaque fois une gageure, car lascension du toit de lEurope, deux fois la meme annee, √† skis, puis √† pied, en portant plusieurs dizaines de kilos dinstruments, demande une sacree dose deffort ! Lequipe inscrit sa demarche dans un souci de respect de son environnement montagnard, et refuse le recours, pourtant possible, √† laide heliportee. Ils montent √† pied ou √† ski, cest une question dethique. La mesure du mont Blanc nautorise surtout pas la demesure !</desc>

<title>Proches de detenus, une autre peine</title>
<desc>√ätre confronte √† lemprisonnement dun membre de sa famille est complique √† gerer. Les proches de detenus se retrouvent souvent demunis et, en Suisse, les associations daide et de soutien se font rares. Les temoignages de ce documentaire sonnent comme un cri dalarme face √† ce manque. Lorsquun proche est emprisonne, cest toute la famille qui en souffre. Les enfants sont particuli√®rement touches. Mais le syst√®me judiciaire suisse ne leur accorde gu√®re dattention. Ils sont, en meme temps que les autres, victimes dun delit avec lequel ils nont rien √† voir. Du jour au lendemain, la m√®re de Romeo a disparu derri√®re les murs de la prison de Hindelbank. Romeo avait alors 13 ans. Seule la famille proche savait que sa m√®re purgeait une peine de plusieurs annees. Pour tous les autres, elle etait en voyage daffaires ou en cure. Par peur de la stigmatisation sociale, des histoires comme celle-ci sont racontees en cachette. Lincarceration dun membre de la famille est toujours un choc pour les proches. Les couples se brisent, les familles se dechirent et il nest pas rare que les parents perdent de vue les besoins de leurs enfants √† cause de leur detresse personnelle. Comment expliquer √† un enfant de cinq ans dont le papa est en detention provisoire quil ne rentrera pas √† la maison avant tr√®s longtemps ? Pour Nadja, dont le mari purge une peine de plusieurs annees √† Thorberg, des questions comme celle-ci sont un defi. Environ 50 000 personnes en Suisse sont " codetenues ", etant des proches. Parmi elles : 9000 enfants. Bien que les consequences de la detention puissent etre graves pour eux, il nexiste pratiquement pas doffres daide pour les personnes concernees en Suisse alemanique. En Suisse romande, en revanche, il existe une offre de soutien generalise pour les proches de detenus. La fondation Relais Enfants Parents Romands propose des consultations directement devant les prisons. Les parents de Rapha√´l auraient egalement souhaite beneficier dune telle proposition. Pendant six mois, leur fils adulte souffrant de troubles psychiques a ete place en detention provisoire. Les visites se sont averees extremement difficiles. Il etait interdit de se toucher et les discussions navaient lieu qu√† travers une vitre de separation. Les conditions de detention de Rapha√´l ont eu un impact direct sur ses parents, qui se sont sentis de plus en plus impuissants - jusqu√† ce quune fin bouleversante vienne clore le sujet. Par ailleurs, les proches jouent un r√¥le important dans la reussite de la resocialisation. Labsence de soutien est donc une occasion manquee non seulement pour les personnes concernees, mais aussi pour lensemble de la societe. Ce film met en lumi√®re des destins qui restent trop souvent tapis dans lombre et montre quil est necessaire dagir au sein le syst√®me judiciaire suisse : Meme de petits changements seraient benefiques, dit le jeune Romeo : telephoner un peu plus souvent ou allonger les heures de visite, cela aiderait dej√† beaucoup les enfants de detenus.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne. De quoi inquieter jusquau PDG de Total energies, Patrick Pouyanne, qui a demande jeudi √† Davos au president americain Donald Trump des garanties sur la securite des approvisionnements de lEurope en gaz naturel liquefie americain... dont TotalEnergies est le principal exportateur.</desc>

<desc>Exploites et maltraites : qui sont les nouveaux esclaves ? Des saisonniers qui travaillent quatorze heures par jour en plein soleil et sans pause, qui dorment entasses sur des matelas dans un hangar insalubre et se partagent pour tout repas une assiette de riz blanc ! Cette situation semble tout droit sortie dun autre √¢ge, elle a pourtant bien lieu en France, dans les vignes de Champagne. En 2023, quatre-vingts travailleurs sans papiers ont ete victimes dun employeur sans scrupule ; ils ont decide de porter plainte : une enquete pour traite detres humains a ete ouverte. Mais pour quelques dizaines qui osent se battre, combien continuent √† se taire, par peur des represailles ? Combien restent prisonniers de conditions indignes ? En 2021, selon les estimations du Global Slavery Index, 135 000 personnes etaient victimes de traite detres humains en France. Mais linfraction, inscrite depuis 2003 dans le code penal, est tr√®s difficile √† caracteriser. Elle a generalement lieu √† huis-clos, les temoins sont peu nombreux et les preuves souvent difficiles √† reunir.</desc>

<title>Proches de detenus, une autre peine</title>
<desc>√ätre confronte √† lemprisonnement dun membre de sa famille est complique √† gerer. Les proches de detenus se retrouvent souvent demunis et, en Suisse, les associations daide et de soutien se font rares. Les temoignages de ce documentaire sonnent comme un cri dalarme face √† ce manque. Lorsquun proche est emprisonne, cest toute la famille qui en souffre. Les enfants sont particuli√®rement touches. Mais le syst√®me judiciaire suisse ne leur accorde gu√®re dattention. Ils sont, en meme temps que les autres, victimes dun delit avec lequel ils nont rien √† voir. Du jour au lendemain, la m√®re de Romeo a disparu derri√®re les murs de la prison de Hindelbank. Romeo avait alors 13 ans. Seule la famille proche savait que sa m√®re purgeait une peine de plusieurs annees. Pour tous les autres, elle etait en voyage daffaires ou en cure. Par peur de la stigmatisation sociale, des histoires comme celle-ci sont racontees en cachette. Lincarceration dun membre de la famille est toujours un choc pour les proches. Les couples se brisent, les familles se dechirent et il nest pas rare que les parents perdent de vue les besoins de leurs enfants √† cause de leur detresse personnelle. Comment expliquer √† un enfant de cinq ans dont le papa est en detention provisoire quil ne rentrera pas √† la maison avant tr√®s longtemps ? Pour Nadja, dont le mari purge une peine de plusieurs annees √† Thorberg, des questions comme celle-ci sont un defi. Environ 50 000 personnes en Suisse sont " codetenues ", etant des proches. Parmi elles : 9000 enfants. Bien que les consequences de la detention puissent etre graves pour eux, il nexiste pratiquement pas doffres daide pour les personnes concernees en Suisse alemanique. En Suisse romande, en revanche, il existe une offre de soutien generalise pour les proches de detenus. La fondation Relais Enfants Parents Romands propose des consultations directement devant les prisons. Les parents de Rapha√´l auraient egalement souhaite beneficier dune telle proposition. Pendant six mois, leur fils adulte souffrant de troubles psychiques a ete place en detention provisoire. Les visites se sont averees extremement difficiles. Il etait interdit de se toucher et les discussions navaient lieu qu√† travers une vitre de separation. Les conditions de detention de Rapha√´l ont eu un impact direct sur ses parents, qui se sont sentis de plus en plus impuissants - jusqu√† ce quune fin bouleversante vienne clore le sujet. Par ailleurs, les proches jouent un r√¥le important dans la reussite de la resocialisation. Labsence de soutien est donc une occasion manquee non seulement pour les personnes concernees, mais aussi pour lensemble de la societe. Ce film met en lumi√®re des destins qui restent trop souvent tapis dans lombre et montre quil est necessaire dagir au sein le syst√®me judiciaire suisse : Meme de petits changements seraient benefiques, dit le jeune Romeo : telephoner un peu plus souvent ou allonger les heures de visite, cela aiderait dej√† beaucoup les enfants de detenus.</desc>

<desc>Le prix du gaz senvole : + 4,8 % en janvier apr√®s plusieurs hausses, dej√†, en octobre et juillet dernier... Avec le froid, les Fran√ßais se chauffent davantage et les stocks ont diminue. Lautre explication reside dans la decision de lUkraine de mettre fin au transit du gaz russe √† travers son territoire, marquant une rupture energetique decisive avec Moscou. Consequence directe : les Europeens - dont le tiers du gaz achete √† la Russie passe par cette voie - ont perdu pr√®s de 15 milliards de m√®tres de cube de gaz, soit pr√®s de 5% de la consommation de lUnion europeenne.

<title>Mina, Tonya</title>
<desc>R: Craig Gillespie. O: Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney. Nii parima naisk√µrvalosataitja Oscari kui ka Kuldgloobuse palvinud ebatavaline eluloodraama 1990. aastate uhest parimast iluuisutajast Tonya Hardingust, kelle vastuoluline karjaar ja intsident tema peamise konkurendi Nancy Kerriganiga pani temast raakima kogu maailma. Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) oli esimene ameeriklanna, kes sooritas jaal v√µimatuks peetud kolmekordse axeli ja t√µestas, et ka naistel on v√µimalik teenida k√µrgeim v√µimalik punktisumma - 6,0. Tema ekstravagantne riietumisstiil ja uisutamisnumbri rokkiv taustamuusika oli konkurentidega v√µrreldes midagi niiv√µrd teistsugust, et Harding muutus kiiresti publiku lemmikuks, samal ajal kui konservatiivsed kohtunikud olid kitsid talle kiitust jagama. Suur roll Tonya elus oli tema kalgil ja ropusuisel emal (Allison Janney), kes kull sisuliselt juhatas Tonya iluuisutamismaailma, kuid kellel kunagi ei jatkunud sudant ega tahet oma tutart t√µeliselt toetada. Ka Tonya taiskasvanuelu polnud meelakkumine, kuid tanu oma vagivaldsele abikaasa Jeffile (Sebastian Stan), kes usutavalt seisis ka Nancy Kerrigani runnaku tellimise taga, sai temast tugev naine, kes teadis, mida tahendab olla vaene ja millist ranka tood tuleb teha tippu j√µudmiseks. Tonya rollis naeme saravat Margot Robbiet ("Wall Streeti hunt"), keda peagi on v√µimalik kinolinal naha Inglismaa kuninganna Elizabeth I osas. Filmi peakangelanna erakordselt kalgi ema kujutamise eest parjati aga Allison Janney ("Juno") nii Oscari kui ka Kuldgloobuse auhinnaga. Filmi re≈æissoor on austraallane Craig Gillespie ("√ïuduste oo").</desc>

<title>Mina, Tonya</title>
<desc>R: Craig Gillespie. O: Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney. Nii parima naisk√µrvalosataitja Oscari kui ka Kuldgloobuse palvinud ebatavaline eluloodraama 1990. aastate uhest parimast iluuisutajast Tonya Hardingust, kelle vastuoluline karjaar ja intsident tema peamise konkurendi Nancy Kerriganiga pani temast raakima kogu maailma. Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) oli esimene ameeriklanna, kes sooritas jaal v√µimatuks peetud kolmekordse axeli ja t√µestas, et ka naistel on v√µimalik teenida k√µrgeim v√µimalik punktisumma - 6,0. Tema ekstravagantne riietumisstiil ja uisutamisnumbri rokkiv taustamuusika oli konkurentidega v√µrreldes midagi niiv√µrd teistsugust, et Harding muutus kiiresti publiku lemmikuks, samal ajal kui konservatiivsed kohtunikud olid kitsid talle kiitust jagama. Suur roll Tonya elus oli tema kalgil ja ropusuisel emal (Allison Janney), kes kull sisuliselt juhatas Tonya iluuisutamismaailma, kuid kellel kunagi ei jatkunud sudant ega tahet oma tutart t√µeliselt toetada. Ka Tonya taiskasvanuelu polnud meelakkumine, kuid tanu oma vagivaldsele abikaasa Jeffile (Sebastian Stan), kes usutavalt seisis ka Nancy Kerrigani runnaku tellimise taga, sai temast tugev naine, kes teadis, mida tahendab olla vaene ja millist ranka tood tuleb teha tippu j√µudmiseks. Tonya rollis naeme saravat Margot Robbiet ("Wall Streeti hunt"), keda peagi on v√µimalik kinolinal naha Inglismaa kuninganna Elizabeth I osas. Filmi peakangelanna erakordselt kalgi ema kujutamise eest parjati aga Allison Janney ("Juno") nii Oscari kui ka Kuldgloobuse auhinnaga. Filmi re≈æissoor on austraallane Craig Gillespie ("√ïuduste oo").</desc>

Ei lahe kaua aega mooda, kui ta on ametiv√µimudele valetanud rohkem kordi, kui suudab ise jarge pidada ning tema uha veidramaks muutuv kaitumine muudab mehe oma naise kadumise peamiseks kahtlusaluseks.

<sub-title>Wiedersehen in Israel: Kriegstrauma und die Hoffnung auf Frieden</sub-title>
<desc>Meron Mendel kehrt nach Israel zuruck. Diesmal begegnet der Direktor der Anne-Frank-Stiftung in Frankfurt einem Land, das um die Ruckkehr der Geiseln bangt. Das sich fragt, wie es jemals wieder ein friedliches Zusammenleben, Vertrauen geben kann zwischen Israelis und Palastinensern. Es ist eine Reise in ein Land, das erschopft ist von einem langen Krieg. Das kaum mehr zu hoffen wagt auf Frieden und Versohnung. Mendel trifft Freunde und Bekannte, die dennoch alles dafur aufwenden, dass genau diese Hoffnung lebendig bleibt. Einige seiner Gesprachspartner hat Mendel bereits bei einem ersten Besuch getroffen, kurz nach dem Massaker vom 7. Oktober 2023. Nun spricht er erneut mit ihnen, fragt danach, was seitdem mit Israel und ihnen passiert ist. Auf einem Teil dieser Reise wird er begleitet von seiner Frau Saba-Nur Cheema und ihren beiden Kindern. Seine Frau ist Muslima, er Jude. Gemeinsam besuchen sie eine der wenigen Schulen in Israel, in denen arabische und judische Kinder gemeinsam unterrichtet werden. Mendel trifft auSSerdem den GroSSvater von Naama Levy, einer jungen Spaherin der israelischen Armee, die von der Hamas als Geisel verschleppt wurde und nach 477 Tagen freigelassen wurde. Meron Mendel besucht extremistische Siedler im Westjordanland, wo im Schatten des Gazakrieges die Spannungen zugenommen haben. Er diskutiert mit ihnen uber ihren Anspruch, das ganze Westjordanland fur Israel zu annektieren. Mendel hat seinen Wehrdienst unter anderem in Hebron im Westjordanland absolviert, wo er im Dienst der Armee Siedler schutzen sollte. Die groSSe Frage, die ihn umtreibt, ist: Wohin steuert das Land durch diesen Krieg und seine Regierung? Was bedeutet das fur das Zusammenleben von Juden und Arabern - fur die Hoffnung auf Frieden? Auf dieser zweiten Reise sucht "auslandsjournal - die doku: Wiedersehen in Israel" mit ihm nach Antworten.</desc>

<title>Was darf man noch sagen? Wut und Wahrheit nach Corona</title>
<desc>Funf Jahre nach der Pandemie steht unsere Gesellschaft vor neuen Herausforderungen. Extreme Positionen dominieren den Diskurs, Zwischentone fehlen - Polarisierung pragt unser Miteinander. Eva Schulz diskutiert mit prominenten Gasten: Satiriker Florian Schroeder fordert mehr Gelassenheit in Debatten, Schauspielerin Eva Herzig beklagt die Gefahr von Nachteilen durch MeinungsauSSerungen, und Intensivpfleger Ricardo Lange mahnt mehr Sachlichkeit an. Der Film untersucht die tiefgreifenden Veranderungen, die die Pandemie in unserer Gesellschaft hinterlassen hat, und ruckt die zunehmende Polarisierung in den Mittelpunkt. Diskussionen uber Gender-Fragen, den Klimawandel oder die Meinungsfreiheit scheinen nur noch in Extremen gefuhrt zu werden: Dafur oder dagegen, schwarz oder weiSS - die Zwischentone sind oft verloren gegangen. Warum ist es so schwer geworden, differenziert zu diskutieren? Welche Rolle spielen soziale Medien, die durch ihre Algorithmen Extreme fordern und die Spaltung verstarken? Journalistin Julia Ruhs zeigt auf, wie Hassnachrichten und scharfe Tone im Netz den Diskurs verandern und die Kluft zwischen den Menschen vergroSSern. Satiriker Florian Schroeder sagt: "Jeder soll alles sagen konnen, auch den groSSten Mist. Das finde ich sehr wichtig." Schauspielerin Eva Herzig, bekannt fur ihre impfkritische Haltung wahrend der Pandemie, verteidigt ihre Meinung gegen alle Anfeindungen: "Ich habe so das Gefuhl, wir leben in einer Gesellschaft, wo es sehr viele Vorurteile gibt, wo es den sogenannten richtigen Weg gibt und wo es viele falsche Wege gibt." Ricardo Lange, Intensivpfleger und Stimme des Gesundheitssystems, spricht uber die emotionale und berufliche Belastung in Krisenzeiten: "Immer dann, wenn Menschen in Not sind, dann zeigt sich das wahre Gesicht der Gesellschaft." Einigkeit herrscht nur in einem Punkt: Die gesellschaftliche Spaltung hat zugenommen. Doch warum? Liegt es an der Moralisierung in den Diskussionen? An Falschinformationen? Oder am Populismus, der differenzierte Ansichten erstickt? In was fur einer Gesellschaft wollen wir leben? Diese Frage steht dabei im Mittelpunkt, denn sie verdeutlicht, wie sehr die Pandemie unser Zusammenleben auf die Probe gestellt hat. Es wird wild diskutiert - uber die Grenzen der Meinungsfreiheit, uber Verantwortlichkeiten und uber die Frage, wie wir wieder produktiv streiten konnen. Es geht um nichts Geringeres als den Zusammenhalt unserer Gesellschaft. Eva Schulz bringt es auf den Punkt: "Miteinander reden, auch wenns unbequem wird."</desc>

<sub-title>Starke Frauen: Kampf um Selbstbestimmung</sub-title>
<desc>Auch im Jahr 2025 gilt Gleichberechtigung oft nur auf dem Papier. Weltweit setzen sich Frauen fur Frauen ein, um veraltete Strukturen zu durchbrechen und einander zu starken. Frei uber den eigenen Weg bestimmen, gleiche Rechte im Beruf, finanzielle Unabhangigkeit: Das sind die wunden Punkte, an denen Initiativen in Deutschland und Ecuador ansetzen. Die Reportagereihe "plan b" begleitet drei engagierte Vorkampferinnen. Eine davon ist die Chirurgin Katja Schlosser. Die Chefarztin am Agaplesion Evangelisches Krankenhaus Mittelhessen setzt sich mit ihrem Verein "Die Chirurginnen" fur Kolleginnen wie Kristina Gotzky ein, damit sie ihren Beruf uneingeschrankt ausuben durfen - auch wenn sie ein Kind bekommen. Das ist in einigen Bundeslandern de facto verboten: Schwangere durfen nicht mehr operieren. Offizielle Begrundung: das Mutterschutzgesetz. Dadurch geraten Chirurginnen gegenuber ihren mannlichen Kollegen ins Hintertreffen. Eine Benachteiligung, die Katja Schlosser nicht hinnimmt. Sie kampft fur ein Mitspracherecht und gleiche Karrierechancen: "Keiner wurde von einer schwangeren Chirurgin erwarten, dass sie sich bei einer OP Rontgenstrahlen aussetzt. Da muss man aber gucken: Wo kann man schwanger operieren? Zwischen ganz und gar nicht gibts doch Wege dazwischen!" Fur sich selbst einzustehen, fallt Madchen aus mannerdominierten Kulturen nicht immer leicht - wie Bahareh Husseini aus dem Iran, die heute in Dusseldorf lebt. "Fruher kannte ich keine Freiheit. Mein groSSer Wunsch war, dass ich studieren kann. Etwas machen, was die Jungs machen", erzahlt die heute 21-Jahrige. Sie schaffte es, nach Deutschland zu fliehen und fand Hilfe bei der Diakonie. Dort leitet Jessica te Heesen ein Projekt namens JUMP. Das unterstutzt junge Frauen beim Sprung in ein selbstbestimmtes Leben. "Fur uns ist es wichtig, dass die Madchen lernen, sich durchzusetzen", sagt te Heesen. JUMP bietet Kurse zum Umgang mit mannlichen Personen, Hilfe in der Schule und bei Bewerbungen. Es gibt auch die Moglichkeit, in eine WG zu ziehen. So finden die Madchen Anschluss und starken sich gegenseitig. Wie gut das funktioniert, sieht man an Bahareh. Sie studiert jetzt medizinische Physik und hilft bei JUMP anderen gefluchteten Madchen, Selbstvertrauen aufzubauen. Genau das treibt auch Patricia Yaselga in ihrer Heimat Ecuador voran. Im Norden des Landes haben viele indigene Frauen kaum eine andere Wahl, als in der alles dominierenden Schnittblumenindustrie zu arbeiten. Die zahlt ihnen nur den Mindestlohn und verseucht mit Pestiziden und Kunstdunger die einst fruchtbaren Boden. Die Folgen: Armut und Mangelernahrung. "Die Blumenindustrie zerstort die indigene Kultur und gefahrdet die Selbstversorgung der Menschen mit gesunden Lebensmitteln", sagt Betriebswirtin Patricia Yaselga. Deshalb hat sie die "Stiftung fur alternative Entwicklung" gegrundet: SEDAL. Zusammen mit ihrer Kollegin Rosa Quimbia bietet sie Workshops fur Frauen an, um sie fur die Bio-Landwirtschaft fit zu machen. Damit werden sie finanziell unabhangig und konnen ihre Familien ernahren. "Es haben immer die Manner die Entscheidungen getroffen, obwohl Frauen die meiste Arbeit leisten. Damit ihr Beitrag wertgeschatzt wird, muss ihre Stimme horbar sein", sagt Patricia Yaselga. Fur Emanzipation kampfen einige der Bio-Bauerinnen inzwischen sogar politisch: als selbstbewusste Abgeordnete in Gemeinderaten.</desc>

<sub-title>Enzian kann todlich sein</sub-title>
<desc>Als das Ehepaar Scheible das Haus der Rosenheimer Krauterhexe Rita Scheible betritt, finden sie diese tot auf. Wer hatte ein Motiv, die alte Dame umzubringen? Stadler und Hansen ermitteln. Sohn Benedikt gibt sich entsetzt, auch Nicole kann nicht verstehen, wer ihre Schwiegermutter umgebracht haben soll. Eine erste Spur fuhrt die Kommissare Anton Stadler und Sven Hansen zu Marlene Thiessen, Eigentumerin des Naturkosmetikstudios "Tausendschon". Den GroSSteil ihres Umsatzes machte Thiessen mit "Scheibles Original Enziancreme", fur die Scheible sie seit Jahren mit dem nur selten wachsenden gelben Enzian belieferte. Tags zuvor hatte Scheible Thiessen mitgeteilt, dass sie in Zukunft keine Krauter mehr liefern werde. Thiessens Creme und ihre berufliche Zukunft standen damit vor dem Aus. Wollte Thiessen die Kundigung abwenden und hat daraufhin Scheible umgebracht? Doch auch Bauunternehmer Bernd Kohler kommt als Tater in Frage. Er wollte Ritas Wiesen, auf denen der gelbe Enzian wachst, kaufen und in Bauland umwandeln. Sohn Benedikt versuchte, den Deal einzufadeln und seine Mutter davon zu uberzeugen. Diese lehnte jedoch das Kaufangebot ab, was sowohl fur Bauunternehmer Kohler als auch fur Benedikt Scheible ein finanzielles Desaster bedeutete. Kohler hatte bereits einen Architekten beauftragt, Benedikt Scheible hatte das Geld gut gebrauchen konnen, um seine Autowerkstatt neu auszustatten. Haben die beiden gemeinsame Sache gemacht? Wahrend Stadler und Hansen einen spannenden Fall zu losen haben, bekommt Andi Lorenz kurzfristig Besuch von Leo Failing, der zur Feier eines Junggesellenabschieds anreist. Dieser findet am Ende auf dem Hof statt, wahrend Marie nichtsahnend in Landshut weilt.</desc>

<sub-title>Benedikts Geheimnis</sub-title>
<desc>Carlos Gonzales, Miteigentumer eines beliebten Cafes, wird tot in seiner Badewanne aufgefunden. Der Fall scheint eindeutig: Spielsucht, Schulden und Depression fuhrten zum Suizid. Dr. Benedikt Forster scheint von der Theorie der Kommissare nicht uberzeugt zu sein und schlieSSt ein Totungsdelikt nicht aus. Er besteht vehement auf eine Obduktion - gegen den Willen des Kriminaldirektors Michael Kaiser. Was treibt den Leiter der Rechtsmedizin an? Auch Emilio Gonzales beschreibt seinen Bruder als psychisch labil. Um ein Haar hatte Carlos durch seine Spielsucht das gemeinsame "Cafe Gonzo" in den finanziellen Ruin getrieben. Liliane Stoger, Kellnerin im Cafe und Ex-Freundin des Opfers, bestatigt das. Aus diesen Grunden hatte sie ein paar Tage vor seinem Tod die Beziehung beendet. Als Kriminalhauptkommissar Jo Stoll jedoch herausfindet, dass Liliane und Emilio fruher ein Paar waren, kommen auch bei ihm Zweifel am Suizid auf: Carlos hatte seinem Bruder die Freundin ausgespannt - ist hier ein Tatmotiv zu finden? Unterdessen obduziert Benedikt Carlos auf eigene Rechnung und findet Hinweise fur ein Totungsdelikt. So gerat auch der Pizzabote Tibor Wanner, der Carlos kurz vor seinem Tod Essen geliefert hatte, ins Visier. Wanners Tochter hatte angeblich einen Nussallergie-Schock im "Cafe Gonzo" erlitten. Daraufhin forderte er Schmerzensgeld von den Brudern, diese hatten sich aber geweigert, zu zahlen. Kam es deshalb zum todlichen Streit? Letzte Folge der aktuellen Staffel "SOKO Stuttgart". Die Folge ist bereits eine Woche vor der Ausstrahlung in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar.</desc>

<sub-title>Zwei Vater</sub-title>
<desc>Mitten in der Sprechstunde wird Bergdoktor Martin zu einem Notfall an die Bergstation der Gondelbahn gerufen. Der Geschaftsfuhrer des Unternehmens, Georg Muhltal, ist zusammengebrochen. Er klagt nun uber Lahmungserscheinungen. Im Krankenhaus stellen Kahnweiler und Martin Gruber fest, dass Georg an einem erblich bedingten Immundefekt leidet. Auch wenn es Georg noch gut geht, mussen sie ihm mitteilen, dass seine √úberlebenschancen gering sind. Sie hoffen auf gute Nachrichten aus dem Labor, um mit der einzigen Therapiemoglichkeit beginnen zu konnen. Georgs Frau Ina und sein Freund und Geschaftspartner Michael Koller machen sich groSSe Sorgen. Regelrecht panisch wird jedoch Michaels Frau Johanna, als sie von der Diagnose erfahrt. Noch in der Fruh war sie mit ihrem einjahrigen Sohn Max in Martins Praxis, weil der Kleine Fieber hatte. Jetzt muss sie Martin offenbaren, dass sie vor einiger Zeit ein Verhaltnis mit Georg Muhltal hatte und befurchtet, dass er der Vater ihres Kindes ist. Wenn dem so ist, hat er Max dann diesen gefahrlichen Gendefekt vererbt? Kaum ist Hans Gruber zu seiner Familie in den Gasthof gezogen, kommt Martin auf die Idee, Anne das freigewordene Zimmer zu geben, damit sie auf dem Gruberhof einen eigenen Ruckzugsort hat. Hans reagiert auf diese Idee beleidigt und das nicht nur, weil er sich uberrumpelt fuhlt, sondern weil er befurchtet, dass sie ihm in seine Arbeit reinredet. Auf dem Gruberhof spitzt sich die Stimmung indes zu. Der alte Hangmaher ist nicht mehr zu gebrauchen, und Hans muss die Arbeit muhsam ohne Maschinenkraft erledigen. Und als ware das nicht schon anstrengend genug, erwartet Susanne abends, dass er den Gasthof schmeiSSt, damit sie sich um die Buchhaltung und die Kinder kummern kann. Martin ist indes froh, dass in der Praxis endlich wieder Normalitat einkehrt. Mit seiner Sprechstundenhilfe Irena Bornholm ist er sehr zufrieden, nur Roman wird mit ihr nicht so richtig warm.</desc>

<sub-title>Zwei Vater</sub-title>
<desc>Johanna Koller muss von Dr. Martin Gruber erfahren, dass ihr kleiner Sohn Max nicht von ihrem Mann Michael ist. Ihre schlimmsten Befurchtungen bewahrheiten sich. Ein Seitensprung mit dem besten Freund und Geschaftspartner ihres Mannes, Georg Muhltal, blieb nicht folgenlos. Aber nicht nur diese dramatische Nachricht schockiert die junge Frau. Georg leidet unter einem erblich bedingten Immundefekt, der nun einen rapide verlaufenden Ausbruch erlebt. Auch Max hat diesen Gendefekt, wird aber nie ahnlich schwer erkranken wie sein Vater. Die Nachricht konnte fur Johanna eine Erleichterung bedeuten, doch sie wird das Geheimnis nicht fur sich behalten konnen. Max ist der Einzige, der seinem leiblichen Vater das Leben retten kann, doch dafur musste man ihn einer Ruckenmarkspunktion unterziehen. Nur, diesem Eingriff muss auch Michael Koller, der betrogene Ehemann, zustimmen, der noch nichts von den neu geordneten Familienverhaltnissen ahnt. Wahrend Martin Gruber mit Diplomatie und Hartnackigkeit alles gibt, um seinem Patienten zuruck ins Leben zu helfen, ist sein Bruder Hans auf dem Hof auf Hilfe angewiesen. Auch wenn er sich nicht in seine Arbeit reinreden lassen mag, so muss er doch einsehen, dass Anne richtig zupacken kann. Und da sie in der Gegend keinen Job findet, unterstutzt sie ihn und Lisbeth gerne bei der Hofarbeit. Hans ist mit seinen Kraften ohnehin am Limit. Nach der anstrengenden Arbeit auf dem Gruberhof muss er abends im "Wilden Kaiser" den Gastwirt mimen, wahrend sich Susanne um Kinder und Buchhaltung kummert. Eine Dauerlosung ist das nicht. Nachdem Anne sich mit ihrem Vater vollkommen uberworfen hat, wird aus ihrem Zufluchtsort, dem Gruberhof, ihre neue Heimat, wo sie nun mit Martin gemeinsam lebt. Doch wird Martin sein Gluck festhalten konnen?</desc>

<sub-title>Zwange</sub-title>
<desc>Eine halsbrecherische Motocross-Tour endet fur Bruno Licht, Inhaber einer Funsport-Agentur, im Scheunentor von Lydia Seibert. Sie lebt hier sehr zuruckgezogen, und Bruno ahnt uberhaupt nicht, dass er nicht nur ihre Scheune beschadigt hat, sondern vor allem ihren geschutzten Raum. Lydia leidet unter schweren Zwangen. Dr. Martin Gruber, der den scheinbar nur leicht verletzten Bruno versorgt, bemerkt, dass mit der jungen Frau etwas nicht stimmt. Ihre zittrigen Hande bereiten ihm ebenso Sorgen wie Brunos Ruckenverletzung. Lydia, die sich eigentlich gar nicht helfen lassen will, stimmt einer Blutuntersuchung zu. Als Martin Gruber erschreckend hohe Calciumwerte feststellt, hat er eine schlimme Vermutung. Um Klarheit zu bekommen, muss Lydia allerdings in die Klinik, und dagegen wehrt sie sich nach Kraften. Auch Bruno, der eine Ruckenprellung erlitten hat, ist wenig einsichtig, was die therapeutischen MaSSnahmen angeht. Er hat keine Zeit, sich zu schonen. Die Vorbereitungen fur ein Fest seiner Firma laufen auf Hochtouren, und auSSerdem hat er das dringende Bedurfnis, bei Lydia Wiedergutmachung zu leisten. Auf dem Gruberhof konnte Hans eigentlich dankbar fur Annes Unterstutzung sein, doch als sie erst einen neuen Hangmaher organisiert und sich dann auch noch mit klugen Ratschlagen zur Futterung der Kuhe einbringt, platzt ihm fast der Kragen. Auch Lisbeths Geduld wird auf eine Probe gestellt, denn Anne genieSSt die uneingeschrankte Aufmerksamkeit von Martin und Lilli. Nicht einfach ist auch das frische Verhaltnis von Kahnweiler und seiner Dr. Vera Fendrich. Sie versucht, sein Leben umzukrempeln, und das ist ihm alles eine Spur zu uberhastet.</desc>

<desc>Martin Grubers Patientin Lydia Seibert leidet unter einer Zwangserkrankung und klagt immer wieder uber Bauchschmerzen, deren Ursache so rasch wie moglich in der Klinik gefunden werden muss. Die Vorstellung, sich unter lauter fremde Menschen ins Krankenhaus zu begeben, ist ein Graus fur Lydia. Doch Bruno Licht steht ihr zur Seite. Seit er mit seiner Motocross-Maschine in ihrem Scheunentor gelandet ist, fuhlt er sich von ihr sehr angezogen. Mit seiner unkomplizierten Leichtigkeit schafft er es, Lydias Vertrauen zu gewinnen. Sie ubersteht den kleinen Eingriff und erhalt grunes Licht, um mit Bruno zu seiner Veranstaltung zu gehen. Aus Anlass des einjahrigen Jubilaums seiner Funsport-Agentur veranstaltet er mit seinem Kumpel ein Dorffest, bei dem die bayerische Sangerin Claudia Koreck ein Konzert gibt. Der Abend beginnt vielversprechend, doch plotzlich bricht Bruno zusammen. Fur Lydia ist dieser Schock zu groSS, auch sie muss in die Klinik. Dort findet Martin mit Vera Fendrichs Hilfe den Schlussel zu Lydias Beschwerden. GroSSe Sorgen bereitet allerdings Bruno, bei dem ein lebensgefahrliches Aneurysma festgestellt wird. Martin Gruber wird von Prof. Fendrich, dem Leiter der Klinik, recht eindringlich gebeten, dafur zu sorgen, dass dessen Tochter Vera und Alexander Kahnweiler eine gluckliche und harmonische Beziehung fuhren. Martin steht der Kopf allerdings ganz woanders. Seine Freundin Anne eckt auf dem Gruberhof immer wieder an. Eine zukunftsfahige Losung ist die derzeitige Situation fur niemanden aus der Familie Gruber. Besonders Hans ist zunehmend gereizt. Susanne spannt ihn im Wirtshaus ein, und auf dem Hof ist es Anne, die ihm immer wieder kluge Ratschlage erteilt. Er hatte groSSe Lust, sie vom Hof zu jagen, doch dagegen weiSS Martin etwas zu unternehmen.</desc>

<title>Lobotomie</title>
<sub-title>Lobotomie: Hirn-OPs fur psychische Gesundheit?</sub-title>
<desc>Mit einem Eispickel ins Gehirn stoSSen und darin herumstochern? Das klingt wie aus einem Horrorfilm. Von den Vierziger- bis in die Sechzigerjahre gab es diese Hirn-OP wirklich: die Lobotomie. Ihr bekanntester Vertreter: der Neurologe Walter Freeman. Die Operation am Gehirn fuhrte er bei tausenden Menschen durch und machte einige zu Pflegefallen. Warum zerstorte ein Arzt die Gehirne von Menschen, und warum galt das als Losung fur psychische Erkrankungen? Psychologe Dr. Leon Windscheid erklart, wie es so weit kommen konnte und klart auf, ob wir heutzutage besser vor medizinischer Willkur geschutzt sind. Wahrend der Lobotomie wurde mit einem spitzen Gegenstand die Schadeldecke durchstoSSen, um dann Nerven im Gehirn zu durchtrennen. Der Arzt und Neurologe Walter Freeman konnte seine Lobotomie sehr erfolgreich vermarkten: Er behauptete, mit seiner Hirn-OP wurden Menschen von schweren psychischen Leiden wie Schizophrenie oder starken Angstzustanden geheilt. Mit Vorher-Nachher-Fotos versuchte er den Erfolg seiner neurochirurgischen Operation zu beweisen. Doch zahlreiche Patientinnen und Patienten waren nach der Lobotomie apathisch, ihrer Emotionen und Personlichkeiten beraubt. Einige starben sogar. Prof. Henrik Walter ist Psychiater und Hirnforscher an der Charite in Berlin und befasst sich mit ethischen Fragen in den Neurowissenschaften. Zur Lobotomie von Walter Freeman hat er eine ganz eindeutige Meinung: "Das war schon damals unverantwortlich und das hat er gemacht, obwohl Leute Infektionen bekamen, obwohl sie geblutet haben, obwohl sie gestorben sind. Und er hat einfach weitergemacht."</desc>

Max und Klaus versuchen, den weiSSen Transporter zu finden. Penny fahrt in die Wohnung der Anruferin, um deren Tochter Nelli zu retten, und macht dort einen grausigen Fund. Nellis Onkel Tobias, Bruder der entfuhrten Sandra, wurde mit einem Messer erstochen. Nellis Vater Florian Tuchel soll gemeinsam mit ihrer Mama fortgefahren sein.

<sub-title>Blume des Bosen</sub-title>
<desc>Im Munchner Rosengarten liegt die Leiche der jungen Gartnerin Miriam Hohmann, aufgebahrt in einem Bett aus weiSSen Lilien. Sie wurde mit einem Hortensien-Extrakt vergiftet. Da die fast schon liebevolle Grabinszenierung auf eine Beziehungstat hindeutet, nehmen sich Bergmann und seine Kollegin Annabell Lorenz zunachst Miriams Gartner-Kollegen Sebastian Wittmer aber auch ihren Bekannten Mike Kugel vor. Der Gartnermeister Sebastian Wittmer, der angeblich seit kurzem in einer Beziehung mit dem Opfer stand, ist am Boden zerstort. Seine Aussagen lenken den Verdacht auf ihre gemeinsame Chefin im Rosengarten, Heike Halbritter. Sie hatte Miriam offensichtlich in der Arbeit schikaniert. Heike Halbritter weist alle Vorwurfe zuruck und bestatigt, dass Sebastian derjenige im Rosengarten-Team sei, der Pflanzengifte extrahieren konne. Allerdings scheint Sebastians Alibi wasserdicht. Sein Vater, der pensionierte Kriminalkommissar Bernhardt Wittmer, bestatigt es. Dagegen finden die Kommissare immer mehr Hinweise darauf, dass Miriams guter Freund Mike Kugel in den Mord verwickelt zu sein scheint. Die Beweislast ist mehr als erdruckend. Doch Mike streitet vehement den Mord ab. Auch Miriams Mutter Tanja kann keine Hinweise in Richtung Mike erkennen. Als ein weiteres Beweisstuck am Tatort gefunden wird, ahnt Caspar Bergmann, was dahintersteckt und entscheidet sich zu einem gewagten Ermittlungsschritt. Die Folge ist bereits eine Woche vor der Ausstrahlung ab 10.00 Uhr in der ZDFmediathek verfugbar. Acht neue Folgen "Der Alte" werden freitags um 20.15 Uhr ausgestrahlt.</desc>

<sub-title>Leipziger Buchmesse 2025 - Zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit</sub-title>
<desc>Es ist Marz und Buchmesse in Leipzig. Dort treffen sich Literaten, Verleger und Buchliebhaber, aber auch Cosplayer und Manga-Spezialisten. Auch koniglicher Besuch steht auf dem Programm, denn Norwegen ist Ehrengast mit dem Motto "Traum im Fruhling", und die norwegische Konigin - selbst Lesebotschafterin - reist an, um Bucher und das Lesen zu supporten. Norwegische Autoren wie Knausg√•rd und Nesb√∏ sind auch in Deutschland beliebt. Aber auch eine der ganz groSSen Schriftstellerinnen Norwegens, Vigdis Hjorth, ist seit zwei Romanen hierzulande ein Begriff. Nun liegt ein dritter Roman auf Deutsch vor. Mit "Wiederholung" folgt sie ihrem Dauerthema: Es geht um sexuellen Missbrauch durch den Vater und die mitwissende, schweigende Mutter. Der Shootingstar der norwegischen Literaturszene, Oliver Lovrenski, lebt in Oslo, genau wie die Protagonisten seines Buches: junge Erwachsene, die ihr Leben nicht gefunden und die familiaren Wurzeln verloren haben, aber Mitglied einer Gang geworden sind, die ihnen die Familie ersetzt. Lovrenski erzahlt davon in einer Weise, die rein sprachlich eine ungewohnliche Leseherausforderung ist. Familie ist der literarische Dauerbrenner dieses Fruhjahrs. Eines der schonsten Bucher der Saison hat Rabea Edel geschrieben: "Portrait meiner Mutter mit Geistern". Wie sehr bestimmen uns die familiaren Wurzeln, und wie kann es gelingen, sich von den Geistern der Vergangenheit zu losen? Die nigerianische Schriftstellerin Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wurde mit "Americanah" zum international gefeierten Literaturstar. Nach zwolf Jahren hat sie einen neuen - mit Spannung erwarteten - Roman vorgelegt: "Dream Count". "aspekte" trifft die prominente Autorin zum Gesprach. Die Leipziger Buchmesse ware nichts ohne die Mangacom und die "verruckten" Cosplayer. Was bewegt diese "Fans", und was fesselt sie an den gezeichneten Geschichten aus Japan? Katty Salie erkundet die Welt der Mangas und Animes. Der Leipziger Buchpreis 2025 wird ebenso Thema sein wie auch der Preis zur Europaischen Verstandigung, den 2015 der belorussische Schriftsteller Alhierd Bachareviƒç bekommt - ein Mann, der ins Exil fliehen musste, weil er in seinem Land von der Regierung verfolgt wird. Der bekannte ukrainische Schriftsteller Serhij Zhadan leitet inzwischen das Frontradio des ukrainischen Militars und schreibt weiter. Sein neues Buch gibt ungeschonte Einblicke in die Lebensrealitat der zivilen Bevolkerung. Jo Schuck spricht mit ihm - uber das Schreiben in Zeiten des Kriegs und den Dienst an der Front. Wohin all das fuhren konnte? Damit beschaftigt sich der fruhere AuSSenminister Joschka Fischer in seinem gerade erschienen Buch "Die Kriege der Gegenwart und der Beginn einer neuen Weltordnung". Und schlieSSlich erinnert "aspekte" an die wunderbare und zu Unrecht fast vergessene Mascha Kaleko, deren Werk auch durch zwei Alben der Musikerin Dota gerade eine Revival erlebt und die es ganz unbedingt wiederzuentdecken gilt.</desc>

<title>Aufgeklart - Spektakulare Kriminalfalle</title>
<sub-title>Der tote Italiener</sub-title>
<desc>In Mannheim wird ein 51-jahriger Italiener auf offener StraSSe erschossen. Ein Mord nach Mafia-Manier? Dafur spricht auch die groSSkalibrige Pistole mit Schalldampfer. Aber vom Tater fehlt jede Spur, und die Polizei tappt uber 20 Jahre im Dunkeln. Erst ein DNA-Test bringt Gewissheit. Der Mord wurde beauftragt und nicht nur mit Geld bezahlt. Eine Liebesnacht mit dem Morder hat weitreichende Konsequenzen. Der Italiener Calogero C. wird 1990 auf offener StraSSe erschossen - zwei Schusse in den Rucken, einen in den Kopf. Schon fruh geht die Polizei allen Hinweisen nach. Konnte die Mafia ihre Finger im Spiel haben? Oder kommt der Morder aus der eigenen Familie? Bereits zwei Jahre nach dem Mord melden sich die Sohne des Opfers bei der Polizei mit einer schier unglaublichen Aussage: Ihre Schwester und Mutter hatten einen Auftragskiller angeheuert, um Calogero C. aus dem Weg zu raumen. Nach mehreren Verhoren gesteht die Tochter zunachst, zieht ihre Aussage dann aber wieder zuruck. Die Polizei hat nichts in der Hand. Bis Jahre spater ein weiterer Hinweis die Polizei erreicht. Der Tater soll nicht nur mit Geld, sondern auch mit Sex bezahlt worden sein. Das Unglaubliche: Diese Liebesnacht trug Fruchte, und die DNA des Kindes kann den Tater nach uber 20 Jahren uberfuhren. Profiler Axel Petermann und Psychologin Katinka Keckeis rekonstruieren diesen spektakularen Kriminalfall. Sie schauen sich noch einmal den Tatort in Mannheim an, treffen auf Ermittler, Experten und Zeugen. Was macht den einen zum Tater, den anderen zum Opfer? Die Doku-Reihe erzahlt bei groSSen Kriminalfallen der deutschen Historie parallel die Geschichten von Tatern und Opfern.</desc>

<title>Die Killer des Kremls. Moskaus mysteriose Morde.</title>
<desc>Abweichler, Journalisten und Oppositionelle leben in Russland gefahrlich. Sie sterben durch Gift, auf offener StraSSe durch Schusse oder unter mysteriosen Umstanden im Arbeitslager. Es scheint fast so, als ob das Regime immer wieder unliebsame Kritiker einfach ausschaltet. Und das zur Abschreckung meist offentlich. Beweise gibt es kaum. Dabei liegt die Taterschaft russischer Geheimdienste nah: Sind sie die Killer des Kremls? Seit Jahren bestehen im Grunde nur wenige Zweifel daran, wie Putins Apparat mit Kritikern oder sogenannten Landesverratern umgeht. Es ist ein autokratisches System, das wenig Widerspruch duldet und frei nach der russischen Redensart "Kein Mensch, kein Problem" operiert. Ein solches Problem stellte wohl auch die Journalistin Anna Politkowskaja dar. Sie wurde im Treppenhaus ihres Wohnhauses hingerichtet. Zuvor recherchierte sie kritisch zu Putin und seinen Verbundeten. Russische Oppositionelle leben dabei besonders gefahrlich. Boris Nemzow war politischer Konkurrent, der in den Augen des Kremls wohl zum Problem wurde. Im Herzen Moskaus wurde der Oppositionsfuhrer erschossen. In beiden Fallen fuhren bis heute die Spuren nach Tschetschenien, regiert von Ramsan Kadyrow - auch bekannt als Putins Bluthund. Jahre spater stirbt ein weiterer Rivale Putins nach jahrelanger Verfolgung in einer russischen Strafkolonie: Alexej Nawalny. Zuvor uberlebte er einen Giftanschlag. Mit ihm verlieren viele die letzte Hoffnung auf ein neues Russland. Einer der letzten Oppositionellen ist Wladimir Kara-Mursa. Er wurde gleich zweimal Opfer von Giftanschlagen. Dennoch kehrte er nach Russland zuruck und landete prompt im russischen Gulag. Nur ein Gefangenenaustausch bewahrte ihn wohl vor einem ahnlichen Schicksal wie Nawalny. Doch er und seine Familie wissen, dass sie ihres Lebens niemals sicher sein konnen. Denn Wladimir Putin ist selbst ein Mann der Geheimdienste. Eines galt fur ihn und seine politischen Freunde schon immer als unverzeihlich: der Verrat. Geheimdienstler, die es wagen, abtrunnig zu werden, besiegeln damit ihr Schicksal. So wie der Ex-KGB-Mann Alexander Litwinenkow. Nachdem er in GroSSbritannien uberlief, wurde er mit einem radioaktiven Kampfstoff in London vergiftet und starb im Krankenhaus. Nirgendwo ist man, so scheint es, vor der Rache des Kremls sicher, auch nicht in Deutschland. Mitten im Berliner Tiergarten wird Zelimkhan Kangoshvili hingerichtet. Er hatte Jahre zuvor in Tschetschenien gegen Russland gekampft. Die deutsche Justiz spricht von einem Mord im staatlichen Auftrag Russlands - ohne jeden Zweifel. Wahrenddessen weist Putin personlich jede Schuld fur politische Auftragsmorde von sich. "Terra X History" zeigt, wie Kritiker des Systems verfolgt werden und welche Spuren in den Kreml fuhren.</desc>

<sub-title>Sudafrika ‚Äì Das umkampfte Paradies</sub-title>
<desc>Sudafrikas groSSter Schatz ist seine Natur. Die Vielfalt an Arten, Landschaften und Lebensraumen zieht Mensch und Tier in ihren Bann. Der Reichtum ist auch Grund fur Gier, Neid und Kampf. Wildtierarztin Hannah Emde erkundet ein Land, das dem Rhythmus von zwei Weltmeeren folgt. Wasser ist der Ursprung des einzigartigen Reichtums Sudafrikas. Doch dieser Schatz erfordert auch besonderen Schutz. Wie lasst er sich fur zukunftige Generationen bewahren? Sudafrikas Kuste erstreckt sich weit uber 2000 Kilometer. An seiner sudlichen Spitze treffen gewaltige Meeresstromungen aufeinander, die ideale Bedingungen fur eine uppige Meereswelt schaffen. Das kalte Wasser des Atlantiks, der Benguelastrom sorgt im Westen fur reiche Fischgrunde, wahrend der warme ostliche Agulhasstrom des Indischen Ozeans tropische Lebensraume schafft. Naheliegend, dass Mensch und Tier von diesem Paradies hier profitieren wollen. Fur die Haie sind es nahrungsreiche Jagd- und Brutgebiete - fur Wassersportler die weltweit begehrtesten Kustenstreifen. Da sind Konflikte quasi vorprogrammiert. Um Mensch und Tier zu schutzen, sollen Haiexperten die Geheimnisse der Tiere luften. Warum kommt es uberhaupt zu Haiattacken und wie lassen sich die Begegnungen mit den Menschen minimieren? Hannah Emde trifft Ryan Daly. Er hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, das Verhalten der Tiere zu entschlusseln. Vor Sudafrikas Kusten sorgen die Meeresstromungen regelmaSSig fur einen ganz besonderen Reichtum. Eines der spektakularsten Naturphanomene - der jahrliche Sardine Run - ist ein Magnet fur zahlreiche Meeresrauber wie Haie, Delfine oder Wale, die sich am reichen √úberangebot der Sardinenschwarme in einem perfekt abgestimmten Jagdspektakel bedienen. Doch nicht nur die Kusten profitieren von den gegensatzlichen Gewassern. Hannah Emde erfahrt aus nachster Nahe, wie das gesamte Land von den Stromungen gepragt wird. Das hochste Gebirge des Landes, die Drakensberge, stoppen die feuchtwarmen Luftmassen, die vom Indischen Ozean aus uber das Land ziehen. Das Gebirge verteilt das Wasser in Flusse, Seen und Boden. Dadurch entstehen vielfaltige Klimazonen - von mediterran uber tropisch bis zum Wustenklima, dort, wo kein Wasser mehr hinkommt. Diese Vielfalt ist der Grund fur den schier endlosen Reichtum der Natur. Hannah Emde folgt dem Weg des Wassers und den Tieren, die davon profitieren. Wer hatte das gedacht: Die groSSten Reptilien Sudafrikas mit einer Lange von uber sechs Metern und dem starksten Kieferdruck im Tierreich gehoren zu den fursorglichsten Eltern. Weibliche Nilkrokodile zeigen eine auSSergewohnliche Brutpflege. Sie transportieren die frisch geschlupften Jungen im Maul und verteidigen sie gegen Feinde. Und sie bewachen ihre Nester mit einem auSSergewohnlichen Trick: mithilfe eines kleinen tierischen Helfers, dem Wellentriel. Doch die Lebensraume der Krokodile - wie Flusse, Seen und Sumpfe - sind zum kostbaren Gut geworden. Hannah Emde entdeckt, an welch skurrilen Orten die Tiere bruten, um zu uberleben. Die Zerstorung naturlicher Lebensraume ist die Hauptursache fur den Ruckgang vieler Tierarten in Sudafrika. Der Reichtum an Bodenschatzen wie Gold und Diamanten, das wertvolle Holz der tropischen Walder, die Fruchtbarkeit weiter Landflachen und die Masse an Wildtieren Afrikas wecken seit jeher Begehrlichkeiten. Um diese Schatze zu bergen, wurde das Land mit seinen Bewohnern zum Teil gnadenlos ausgebeutet. Hannah Emde untersucht die Herausforderungen, denen sich Sudafrika heute stellen muss. Wie viel Natur gibt es noch? Wo existiert noch unberuhrte Wildnis? Lasst sich der Kampf noch gewinnen und die Schatze Sudafrikas bewahren? Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, begleitet Hannah Emde Menschen, die sich diesem Kampf verschrieben haben. Sie begleitet ihre sudafrikanischen Kolleginnen und Kollegen bei der Geburtenkontrolle einer Lowin. Sie nimmt an einer spektakularen SchutzmaSSnahme fur Nashorner teil und begibt sich auf die Spur professioneller Jager, die nur fur das Gute toten. "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde: Sudafrika - das umkampfte Paradies" fuhrt in ein Land, dessen Reichtum einen ganz besonderen Schutz benotigt. Glucklicherweise gibt es viele Menschen, die alles geben, um die verlorenen Schatze zu bewahren. Hannah Emde lasst sich und die Zuschauer von Sudafrika in seinen Bann ziehen. Letzte Folge der Reihe "Terra X: Faszination Erde - mit Hannah Emde: Sudafrika - das umkampfte Paradies" Alle drei Folgen sind ab 13. Marz 2025 vorab in der ZDFmediathek abrufbar.</desc>

<title>Titanic - Expedition ins Herz des Wracks</title>
<desc>Der Untergang der "Titanic" ist die beruhmteste aller Schiffskatastrophen und wurde zum Mythos. Seit mehr als 100 Jahren liegt der Ozeanriese in den eiskalten Tiefen des Nordatlantiks. Erst 1985 wurde das Wrack entdeckt und seitdem von mehreren aufwendigen Tauchexpeditionen besucht. Die letzte fand 2019 statt und lieferte spektakulare Bilder. Vielleicht die letzten. Denn Bakterien, die Metall zersetzen, beschleunigen den Verfall der "Titanic". Die "Titanic" war das groSSte Schiff seiner Zeit und galt als unsinkbar. Umso schockierter war die Welt, als der Ozeanriese bei seiner Jungfernfahrt im April 1912 sank und rund 1500 Menschen in den Tod riss. Das Wrack liegt etwa 3800 Meter tief in volliger Finsternis und war lange Zeit unerreichbar. Nach vielen gescheiterten Versuchen entdeckte schlieSSlich ein Team aus amerikanischen und franzosischen Wissenschaftlern 1985 das Wrack. Spater verfilmte der Regisseur James Cameron den Untergang in einem der groSSten Hollywoodblockbuster aller Zeiten und bezog auch das Wrack mit in die Dreharbeiten ein. Seither gelang es Forschungsteams mehrfach, in die lebensfeindliche Tiefe vorzudringen, das Wrack zu vermessen und seinen Zustand zu dokumentieren. Fur die jeweiligen Expeditionsleiter, darunter auch James Cameron, waren die Expeditionen die aufregendsten Projekte ihres Lebens, von denen sie in exklusiven Interviews berichten. Die Forschungsmoglichkeiten wurden uber die Jahrzehnte kontinuierlich besser. Leistungsstarkere U-Boote, 3-D-Scans und mikrobiologische Untersuchungen geben heute Aufschluss uber den Ablauf des Untergangs und den Zustand des Wracks. Immer wieder gelang es auch, Gegenstande zu bergen. Mehr als 5000 Objekte sind mittlerweile gerettet und konserviert. Die Fundstucke und Videoaufnahmen, die die Forscher mit an die Wasseroberflache brachten, geben einen emotionalen Einblick in das Geschehen von 1912. Die Forschungen sind ein Wettlauf gegen die Zeit, denn das Wrack, das heute als UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe unter Schutz steht, zerfallt immer mehr. Es rostet nicht nur, es wird zersetzt von einer riesigen Kolonie Metall liebender Bakterien. Wie viel Zeit bleibt den Forschern, um die Ratsel des beruhmtesten Schiffswracks der Welt zu luften? Eine Geschichte, die technische Moglichkeiten, neue meeresbiologische Erkenntnisse sowie den Abenteuergeist der beteiligten Forschungsteams zu einer spannenden Dramaturgie verwebt.</desc>

<sub-title>Konigskinder</sub-title>
<desc>Wahrend einer Klettertour mit seinem Freund Vincent Braun verliert Karl Grunfeld den Halt, sturzt ins Seil und prallt gegen die Felswand. Dr. Martin Gruber und sein Bruder Hans leisten gemeinsam mit den Kollegen der Bergrettung erste Hilfe. Wahrend Karl Gluck im Ungluck hatte, stellt sich bei Vincent heraus, dass eine verschleppte Mandelentzundung zu einem irreversiblen Herzklappenfehler fuhrte. Eine Operation ist unumganglich. Vincent, der dabei ist, seinen Schulabschluss nachzuholen, erkennt nur durch Martins Vehemenz den Ernst der Lage. Die Diagnose schockiert nicht nur Vincents besten Freund Karl, sondern auch dessen Schwester Lena, die tief in sich verborgen Gefuhle fur Vincent hegt. Auch wenn die drei schon seit fruhester Kindheit miteinander befreundet sind, zeigt Karls Vater Ludwig Grunfeld keinerlei Regung ob der schweren Erkrankung des Jungen. Denn eigentlich hatte er Vincent langst aus dem Dunstkreis der Familie verbannt, weil er ihm die Schuld am Tod seiner Frau gibt. Die Umstande des tragischen Unglucks sind fur Ludwig Grunfeld eindeutig, doch zeigt sich, dass die Wahrheit eine andere ist. Auf dem Gruberhof herrscht dicke Luft. Hans gerat immer wieder mit Anne aneinander, und auch zwischen ihm und Susanne haufen sich die Streitereien. So wundert es ihn wenig, dass er nun auch noch in die Schule zitiert wird. Jonas, Susannes Sohn, zeigt Auffalligkeiten, und seine Lehrerin Mia Thalbach mochte ein ernstes Gesprach fuhren. Einziger Lichtblick ist die Attraktivitat der sympathischen Lehrerin. Anlass zur Sorge bereitet auch Arthur Distelmeier. Als Anne ihn wieder einmal sturzbetrunken findet, zieht sie wieder zu ihm. Vom Trinken halt ihn das nicht ab. Anne ist verzweifelt und muss erkennen, dass Arthur Alkoholiker ist. Wird er jemals einer Therapie zustimmen? "Der Bergdoktor: Konigskinder (2)" wird am Samstag, 19.
